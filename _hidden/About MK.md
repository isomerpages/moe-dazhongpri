What is MOE Kindergarten  

We started MOE Kindergarten (MK) to provide quality and affordable Kindergarten 1 (K1) and Kindergarten 2 (K2) education to&nbsp;Singapore Citizens (SC) and Permanent Residents (PR)&nbsp;.

Our&nbsp;[curriculum and programmes](https://www.moe.gov.sg/preschool/moe-kindergarten/curriculum)&nbsp;focus on:

*   Holistic development.
*   Integrated and active learning.
*   Learning through purposeful play and quality interactions.
*   Developing confidence and social skills.
*   Building a good foundation in literacy and numeracy.
*   Nurturing bilingualism through learning activities in both English and Mother Tongue Language (i.e. Chinese, Malay and Tamil languages).


#### Vision, Mission &amp; Values


Our vision is to provide a strong start for every child. We seek to do so through providing quality pre-school education that is affordable to Singaporeans and catalysing quality improvements in the sector.
