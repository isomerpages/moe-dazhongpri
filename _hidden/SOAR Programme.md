<h3>SOAR Programme</h3>
<p>The SOAR Programme is set up to design a differentiated curriculum to
stretch the learning of P4 and P5 HA students, that is aligned to the Dazhong
Experience and the Desired Outcomes of HAL Provisions by GEB.</p>
<p>It aims to provide opportunities of giving broader and more in-depth DZE
learning experiences to these students. Through exposure to this differentiated
curriculum, students’ critical, creative thinking skills which are essential
to overcome 21st century challenges would be developed and honed. Embracing
the spirit of innovative teaching and learning, teachers constantly revise,
fine-tune and customise the curriculum to stretch the potential of our
young learners.</p>
<p>SOAR Programme students are engaged to:</p>
<p>• Learn beyond the syllabus</p>
<p>• Work with others to find innovative ways to improve the community (POS2.0
SL2)</p>
<p>• Explore interdisciplinary connections across the Total Curriculum (8
Spokes)</p>
<p>• Deepen collaboration, communication, and critical thinking skills (8
Spokes)</p>
<p>• Be involved in Authentic Learning (8 Spokes)</p>
<h4>Structure of SOAR Programme</h4>
<p>The programme is differentiated and extended from the school’s core mainstream
syllabus in terms of Content, Process, Product and Learning Environment
(Maker, 1982), and based on students’ readiness, interests and passions
and their preferred approaches to learning (Tomlinson, 2001).</p>
<p>There are 2 parts to the SOAR Programme:</p>
<p>1) P4 and P5 HA students are banded into HA classes. EL Reading Circles
and E2K Math will be conducted for 2 periods within curriculum time, per
week per subject (min 20 hrs per year); and Science E2K will be conducted
after curriculum time</p>
<p>2) Beyond curriculum programmes, such as</p>
<p>a) Competitions; and</p>
<p>b) Greenmaker SDP Programme (under ALP)</p>
