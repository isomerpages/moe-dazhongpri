#### P5 Smart Homes ALP Programme 2023

Our Primary 5 students collaborated in their teams to showcase a solution that will lead to saving energy or saving water at home and designed a poster to advocate for saving energy and sustainability during the final sessions of the P5 Smart Homes ALP Programme 2023! They have been really EXCITED and deeply ENGAGED in designing and showcasing their final Smart Home prototype using the LEGO SPIKE Prime Set. They have been EMPOWERED to engage in self-directed learning on Student Learning Space to gain AWARENESS of sustainability issues in Singapore, take ACTION to build intelligent robots, and become ADVOCATES by promoting their project ideas to others using posters.
