**I****nterview with an alumna of Dazhong!**

Mdm Maria, an alumna of Dazhong in the 1970s, shared her schooling experience at the then Tai Cheong School with our students!

**Did you know?**  
\- The school was situated on a hill back then, and students such as Mdm Maria had to walk 20 min to get to school.<br>
\- The school was a one-storey building, unlike the beautiful colourful seven-storey building we enjoy now<br> \- The school was well-known for having excellent and well-behaved students, just like our Dazhong students<br>
\- Students back then did not have the chance to join CCAs, although they did participate in Sports Day and Children's Day celebrations

**Primary 6 Community Walk**

We kicked off our celebrations with a Community Walk on 8th January! Our Primary 6 students distributed limited edition 80th Anniversary magnets to members of our neighbouring community to invite them to join us in the celebrations. 

Our young Dazhong ambassadors displayed courage and graciousness as they engaged our community from all walks of life!

  
Our Primary 1 to 5 students were not left out! Students from every level worked together to run/walk 80 rounds around different parts of the school to commemorate this special 80th year for Dazhong! That's a total of 400 rounds!
What's more, students from the MOE Kindergarten @ Dazhong took part too!
