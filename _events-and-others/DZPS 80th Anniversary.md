**I****nterview with an alumna of Dazhong!**

Mdm Maria, an alumna of Dazhong in the 1970s, shared her schooling experience at the then Tai Cheong School with our students!

**Did you know?**  
\- The school was situated on a hill back then, and students such as Mdm Maria had to walk 20 min to get to school.<br>
\- The school was a one-storey building, unlike the beautiful colourful seven-storey building we enjoy now<br> \- The school was well-known for having excellent and well-behaved students, just like our Dazhong students<br>
\- Students back then did not have the chance to join CCAs, although they did participate in Sports Day and Children's Day celebrations
