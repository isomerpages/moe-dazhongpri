### Prize Giving Day 2021

Themed 'Dare to Lead', Prize-Giving Day (PGD) is an important platform to affirm and celebrate the achievements and contributions of our students, staff and partners!

We would like to thank our Guest-of-Honour, Ms Charlene Chang, for gracing the occasion as well as parents and partners for joining us virtually at the PGD to share the joy and successes with the prize winners! 

  

We would also like to thank Mr Nigel Phang, our Vice-Principal, for his contributions in leading the school over the past few years. We wish him all the best for his new endeavour.
