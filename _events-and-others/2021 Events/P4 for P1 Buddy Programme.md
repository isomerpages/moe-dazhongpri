### P4-P1 Buddy Programme

Recess time is always a fun and special time for our students. 

  

This year, since the start of school, our P4 students served beyond themselves by being buddies to their P1 juniors during their recess time. They helped our P1s adjust to the various routines during recess, such as keeping safe distancing, doing the Wipe Down routine, queuing up and paying for their food. 

  

A very important responsibility and a good opportunity for our P4 students to practise their peer support skills! Our P4 students also displayed their school value of Acceptance as they performed their buddy duties well, caring for their P1 buddies. In return, our P1 students had a good and fun-filled recess experience, allowing them to be well-adjusted to school life.

  

A good display of Student Leadership and Peer Support at Dazhong! Dare to Lead!
