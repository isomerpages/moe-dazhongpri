### Student Leadership Workshop 2021

The annual Student Leadership development workshops has kicked off to a good start despite the constraints posed by Covid-19. The team adapted the teaching delivery and adopted a blended approach. A virtual training session was done via Zoom to drive a centralized message of Dare to Lead - our school’s theme for the year to our student leaders. This was followed by customized training for the various student leaders tailored to their specific roles at different venues.

The workshop involved a diverse group of student leaders – Subject Monitors, Class Monitors, CCE Leaders, ICT Champions, Peer Support Leaders and Prefects! The workshop has equipped the students with the fundamental leadership knowledge and skills. From their reflections at the end of the workshop, our student leaders displayed an increased awareness of their role as student leaders and were able to apply the various practical skills in their duties, serving beyond themselves in service of their peers!

A great display of our Dare to Lead spirit!
