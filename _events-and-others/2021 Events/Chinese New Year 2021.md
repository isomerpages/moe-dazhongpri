### Chinese New Year 2021

Despite restrictions due to the pandemic, our students were meaningfully engaged in the joyous celebration as we usher in the Year of the Ox. They were involved in a series of classroom activities that are aligned with our Green Makers ALP initiative. Students from all levels were involved in a myriad of craft activities such as making Floral Petals, Pussy Willows, Mosaic Art and creating a big portrait as a class. 

The Dazhong family wishes you and your family a safe and prosperous Lunar New Year!
