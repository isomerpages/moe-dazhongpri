### National Day Celebration 2021

We celebrated National Day as a school on 6 Aug! The theme for this year’s National Day Parade is “Together, Our Singapore Spirit”.  ‘Together’ evokes our common Singapore identity and Singaporeans coming together as one united people.  ‘Our Singapore Spirit’ calls on Singaporeans to draw new strength from our “can-do” spirit amidst challenging circumstances from COVID-19 and potential disruptions in the new decade.

Our teachers led students in meaningful discussions about their aspirations for Singapore and what they hope for in future.  The students penned their thoughts down on appreciation cards which are displayed.

The NDP theme song, “The Road Ahead” tells of the adversity Singapore has faced throughout its history, and about how the nation has overcome the odds.  Together, we will do it again.  In line with our school values of Excellence and Resilience, we encourage our students to learn and display our school values through this year's National Day activities and to live out those values.

In line with our Green Makers ALP and Math Exploration Week, students were engaged with a week-long Math Escape Room SLS activity. Students had to collect shapes and creatively design items based on the themes Together, our Singapore spirit, places of interest and historical places.  Though we were not able to sing our favourite National Day songs, we used recyclable materials to make percussion and clap along to the beat.
