### Stories Come Alive

In conjunction with World Book Day, International Friendship Day and EL Fiesta, well-loved book characters from around the world gathered at Dazhong Primary School to inspire the love of reading in Stories Come Alive! Being concerned citizens, our students and staff thoughtfully put on their Green Maker hats and lovingly creating their costumes using recycled materials. We had so much fun and it inspired all of us to do much more!Â 

Dazhong, Dare to Read and Inspire!
