### CNY Celebration/MTL Fortnight 2022

**MOTHER TONGUE FORTNIGHT PROGRAMME (MTFP) PART 1** \- Chinese New Year (CNY) 2022 and Cultural (Art) Appreciation

  

The MTFP Part 1 cum 2022 CNY Celebrations is organized by the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department. 

  

This year‘s programme was designed, in collaboration with other departments, with age-appropriate activities that were aligned to the school’s new focus and directions. Students were engaged and empowered to put into action their will to support a sustainable environment, while learning about the cultural aspects of CNY.

  

During the four-day programme (26 to 31 Jan 2022), the Cultural (Art) Appreciation activities during MTL lessons and eve of CNY, allowed students to make handicrafts with recycled materials, via SLS lesson packages.

  

Through these activities, students exhibited self-directed learning, responsibility and acceptance. Their perseverance and aim for excellence led them to create excellent artefacts. 

  

Students also have the opportunity to exhibit the attributes of being concerned citizens and serving leaders for the community, by participating in the fundraising for the Lions Clubs of Singapore.
