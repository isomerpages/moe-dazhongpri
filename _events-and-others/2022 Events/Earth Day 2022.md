### Earth Day 2022

This year’s Earth Day theme is ‘Invest In Our Planet ’, a reminder for us to love and protect the Earth for our future generations.

Dazhong Primary collaborated with MOE Kindergarten to bring about several learning experiences for our students - The ‘Semakau Landfill ’ and ‘Clean the Ocean  ’ Experience. 

All it takes is for everyone to be aware of the effects of climate change and to take actions - to refuse, reduce, reuse and repurpose waste, advocating for others to do likewise. 


We have also launched the ‘Dazhong Green Challenge’ in school where students will earn points when doing green actions - such as bringing recyclables to feed the hungry monster bins in class. 

Let’s join hands to go green, for our future.
