### Cyber Wellness & Total Defence Day


Dazhong Primary School commemorates Total Defence Day annually to mark Singapore’s fall to the Japanese in 1942. Total Defence Day serves to remind our students that Singapore is defensible and is worth defending, and we ourselves must defend Singapore.

As part of our efforts to reinforce the LLP and the ALP disposition of Green Makers @ Dazhong, Total Defence Day classroom-based activities were designed to engage, excite and empower students to:


*   develop an awareness of the relevance of the six Total Defence pillars     
*   take action to be a concerned citizen by staying rooted and doing our part to keep Singapore safe
*   advocate others to do likewise

  

To strengthen our school’s commitment to Total Defence, we conducted a Mass Assembly on 10 February. Using a digitalised skit on Climate Change, performed by our CCE leaders, P1 to P6 students had the opportunity to develop their Social and  Economical Defences. They learnt the importance of being a concerned citizen and taking action by striving to refuse, reduce, reuse and recycle resources. They also learnt the importance of keeping one’s personal information safe and how not to fall prey to scams and fake news. This is to emphasise the importance of Digital Defence and the need to always stay vigilant to keep oneself safe online.  

  

During CCE and Social Studies Current Buzz lessons, students connected and recognized how their daily actions can contribute to Total Defence. To develop students’ appreciation for Singapore’s defences, they wrote inspirational cards to frontliners like the policemen, firefighters, nurses, doctors and soldiers. They also demonstrated how they could play a part in Psychological Defence by making TDD Commitment Pledges to keep our nation safe and secure during their CCE lessons. 


Through these activities and our daily routines of showing social consideration such as doing the wipe-down and maintaining social-distancing, and social inclusivity such as showing kindness and understanding to one another, we hope to ingrain in our students the importance of making Total Defence a way of life. 
  

Because only Together, We Can Keep Singapore Strong.
