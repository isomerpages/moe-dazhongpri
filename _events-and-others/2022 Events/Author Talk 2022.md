### Author Talk 2022
  
On 28 July, our students were regaled with stories by one of Singaporeâ€™s best-selling and award-winning authors, Mr Neil Humphreys. His witty sense of humor and barrage of real-life funny stories enthused the audience and made our students go WILD! Without doubt, the Author Talk was an exciting, engaging and inspiring experience for our students as they learnt how ordinary ideas from everyday life can be transformed into a book! Coinciding with Author Talk, students had the opportunity to purchase from a wide selection of books at a book fair over two days. Our students were all eager to have their books autographed by Mr Neil Humphreys at a book signing this morning! Thank you, Mr Neil Humphreys, for gracing us with your presence! Your visit has no doubt empowered our students to read and write with renewed energy and purpose! Dazhong, Dare to Inspire!
