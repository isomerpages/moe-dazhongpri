### Total Defence Week 2020

Three Departments, Science, National Education, and ICT, collaborated to conduct the Total Defence Week for the whole Dazhong. During this season of COVID-19, the Total Defence Week focused on how Singapore is having "all hands on deck" to combat the virus, and showed students the part we can all play, through various Total Defender Recess Activities and morning engagements in class.
