**Students’ Reflection**

**(1) Soh Yarapa (6A)**<br>
We had been working hard for the competition. There were a lot of challenges to overcome. We worked together as one to get it done. We could not really meet up to do it together. We also had time constraint. Despite time constraints, we all put in our best effort to finish it on time. Everyone being self- directed by doing it at home and we communicated through Whatsapp group. Our teachers have guided us and helped us during the difficult time. We used padlet and google.doc to upload our pictures and to see the guidelines.

**(2) Lai Jia En Alicia (5A)**<br>
Through this experience, I learnt to work together as a group and overcome all the obstacles we met. In order for the work to be submitted on time and done properly, we had to be responsible and complete it on time. We also had to remember to bring it to school to submit it and let another person colour. Throughout the entire experience, there was a lot of homework and we also had to revise for our exam. It was hard to balance both my academic and this. However, I learnt to manage time properly and as a result, I could do well in my studies and at the same time, finish the drawing on time.

**(3) Emelia Soh (5A)**<br>
It was the exam period, but all of the students who took part in this comic competition were helping out. After the PSLE, P6 students also helped out. We all did separate work and had good cooperation. My partner drew and I coloured. We also discussed the things we do not know on Whatsapp.

**(4) Hee Kit Kei (6A)**<br>
Even though, we were having our SA2, we tried to take out some time to complete it. We used Whatsapp to communicate better, teachers told us all the plan through Whatsapp, so we knew what we were supposed to do when we met. I think we did a great job.
