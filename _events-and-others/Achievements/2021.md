**Green Awards**

  

On Saturday (23 Jan), Mrs Liang received the Sustainable South West Award from Grace Fu and Low Yen Ling, for Dazhong's Environmental efforts. The Award recognises corporate and community organisationsâ€™ efforts towards environmental sustainability, and Dazhong is one of the two schools to receive it!

At the ceremony, a video was also shown about where the items we put in the blue recycling bin goes, which has to eventually be sorted out by workers. Let's show the value of responsibility as we put only the correct recyclables into the blue bins, and graciousness to wash dirty items like bottles so the workers have a more hygienic environment.
