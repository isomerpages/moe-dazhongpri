#### P5 Camp

Dazhong, Dare to Shine! This was the theme of our P5 Camp this year. With the easing of SMM, students were given the opportunity to try out the high element activities where they were challenged by choice and stayed overnight together with their peers at the campsite. Students demonstrated peer support by helping  & encouraging one another and affirming their peers' effort throughout the camp. 

On the last night of the camp, students celebrated their successes through group performances and class cheers. They came together as a cohort to cheer for one another during a campfire.

Check out the video below to watch the strong bond our students had forged with their peers and the level of excitement and enthusiasm they demonstrated throughout the entire 3 day 1 night camp.

Well done P5 students! Dazhong Dare to Learn, Dare to Lead, Dare to Serve and....Dare to Shine!
