### NSG Oath Taking

Our student athletes participated in the school-based National School Games (NSG) Oath-Taking Ceremony on 23 Feb. The ceremony marked the start of the NSG for 2023. It highlights the roles of different stakeholders in ensuring the NSG is conducted fairly and safely and form positive experiences for all. All the best to our student athletics at the NSG competitions. Dazhong, Dare to Shine!
