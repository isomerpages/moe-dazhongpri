### World Thinking Day and Founder's Day

ðŸŒŽðŸŒŸðŸŽ‰Dare to Shine! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŒŸðŸŒŽ

The Dazhong Primary School's Scouts and Brownies commemorated World
Thinking Day and Founder's Day today! It was a memorable event filled with
excitement and pride.

We watched inspiring messages from both Headquarters and recited our
promises. It was truly heartwarming to see all the Scouts and Brownies come
together to celebrate these special days.

We are proud to be a part of this incredible organization that promotes
leadership, community service, and personal growth. Let's continue to make a
positive impact on the world, one step at a time!

own pictures and memories in the comments below. Dare to Shine!âœ¨âœ¨
