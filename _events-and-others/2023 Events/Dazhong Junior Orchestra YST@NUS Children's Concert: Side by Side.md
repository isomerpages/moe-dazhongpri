#### Dazhong Junior Orchestra - YST@NUS Children's Concert: Side by Side

Dazhong Junior Orchestra - YST@NUS Children's Concert: Side by Side: 12th March 2023

It had been a wonderful and great learning journey for our JO students who were mentored by YST students from 4th February to 11th March 2023. A total of 6 mentoring sessions and finally a Children's concert where Dazhong JO students played side by side with their YST mentors at YST Concert Hall on Sunday, 12th March 2023. We celebrated our JO students' success through their performances. Some of our JO students did solo pieces while playing by ear as they listen and respond to the rhythm playing by the main conductor. Parents, JO alumni plus staff also came down to support the event. 

Coming up events: Our 85th Anniversary Community Day - Saturday, 1st July 2023 and 85th Anniversary Arts Festival - Saturday, 29th July 2023. JO students will be performing at these events too. Stay tuned for more updates nearing the Community Day and Arts Festival 2023. 

Dazhong, Dare to Shine! ðŸ˜„âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨
