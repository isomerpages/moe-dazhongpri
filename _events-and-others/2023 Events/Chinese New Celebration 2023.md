The theme of our Chinese New Year’s celebration is ‘Dare to Shine’ New Year, encouraging our students to perform acts of kindness for others, while celebrating the Dare-To-Learn spirit. This is in line with the launch of "Shine On! 85 Acts of Kindness" in Term 1. 

One week prior to Chinese New Year, our students had the opportunity to learn more about the festival through various cultural activities, while doing their part for the environment and the community. These included a SLS lesson for students to observe and document what they see, hear, smell, touch and taste during this festive season. Through this activity, they honed their self-directed learning skills by exploring, documenting and reflecting on what they learnt about the festival. Students were also engaged in cultural activities during their CCE lessons, such as the making of red packets using recyclable items.  

Our CNY concert was held on 19 January 2023 in the school hall where students watched the Chinese New Year concert live! Our partners - the School Advisory Committee (SAC) members and the seniors from Lion Befrienders also joined us in this joyous occasion. 

Before the concert, our SAC members and Parent Support Group (PSG) members, planted trees in our school. This event kickstarted our school's 85th Anniversary celebrations and also our way of showing kindness to the environment. The entire process was recorded and showcased during our CNY concert, so that our students would be aware and further inspired to care and be advocates for the Green Movement.  

Through the celebration, students exhibited self-directed learning, responsibility and acceptance. Their perseverance and aim for excellence led them to create excellent artefacts. 

Students also had the opportunity to exhibit the attributes of being concerned citizens and serving leaders for the community, by participating in the fundraising for the Lions Clubs of Singapore.

This was indeed a meaningful and joyous occasion for all in Dazhong!
