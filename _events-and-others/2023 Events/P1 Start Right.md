### P1 Start Right @ Dazhong

We're delighted to welcome the P1 students to our big Dazhong family on the first day of school! The children were brimming with excitement when they interacted and played games with their teachers and friends. They had a lot of fun with the hands-on activities too! As for the parents, they had the chance to learn more about our online learning platform as the teacher facilitators brought them through a lesson using the Student Learning Space (SLS). The most exciting part of the day was definitely the Parent-Child Recess. Happy faces could be seen all around the canteen! We hope everyone had a memorable first day of school and we look forward to a year of joyful learning and rich experiences. Dazhong, Dare to Shine!
