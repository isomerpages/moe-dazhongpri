<h3>Digital Access at Home</h3>
<p>For those <strong>without</strong> devices or Wi-Fi connection at home,
we recommend <strong>applying for DigitalAccess@home</strong>	(<a href="https://go.gov.sg/digitalaccessinfo" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/digitalaccessinfo</a>)
to explore subsidised equipment procurement.<strong> Parents may apply using their SingPass credentials.</strong> 
</p>
<p>At Dazhong, we have <strong>devices</strong> stationed <strong>at the library</strong>.
Students may use the devices in the library for learning during their break
times. Chromebooks are also available at the library for students to access
after school hours. <strong>Students must present a letter from their parent or guardian to the librarian, granting permission for the child to remain in the library for online homework purposes.</strong> Please
also note that this would be on a first-come-first served basis, because
we have limited devices in the library.</p>
