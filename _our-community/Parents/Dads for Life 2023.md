### Dads For Life 2023


#### World Water Day

World Water Day was held on 4 March 2023 at Jurong Lake Garden. Dads For Life participated in the event held in collaboration with the Green Makers and the School Scouts. What a great day as participants did a park clean-up and went on a scavenger hunt. A big thank you to all for making it an event to remember!
