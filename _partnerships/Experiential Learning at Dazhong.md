### Experiential Learning @ Dazhong
  
 On 12 April 2019, we hosted 3 pre-school centres for the Experiential LearningÂ @ Dazhong event. Pre-school students were given the opportunity to experience primary school life and participate in our International Friendship Day activities. Our CCE leaders also impressed parents by sharing proudly about Dazhong's school history and our place in the Hong Kah North neighbourhood. We hope that the experience will help pre-schoolers in the community transit better to Primary 1.
