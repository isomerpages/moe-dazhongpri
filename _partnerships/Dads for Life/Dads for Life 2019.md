### Dads For Life 2019

The Dad’s for Life (DFL) programme in Dazhong Primary School was set up with the following objectives in mind:  

a.       Promote father-child bonding through sporting and outdoor activities, and

b.       Create platforms for fathers to contribute to their children’s schooling experiences and be good influences in the total development of their children.

2019 is an exciting year for Dad’s for Life.  One of the reason is the formation of a core team of dads who would organize and run events for other dads and their children.  The other reason would, of course, be the events that we have installed for dads.  

1.       Formation of the core team

The core team consisting of 6 members was formed and they formally met for the first time on 23 Feb 2019.  The core team members are Richard Rowe, Denn Huang, Lau Chau Chin, Chai Kok Soon, Sridhar Pattabhiraman, and Mohamed Ziawoodeen.  In that meeting, interesting ideas were tossed, good discussions were had, and events for the year were identified.  Everyone was excited and raring to roll out the plans.

2.       First event for the year

The first event was held on 16 March 2019 in school.  It was a fun time for dads and their kids to play soccer and badminton together.  The participation was great with about 150 dads and children and some moms too.  It was nice to see dads playing with their children, coaching them, organizing the games for them, and just having fun with them.  It was definitely time well spent on the Saturday morning.

One Father is more than a hundred schoolmasters' - a wise man once said! It was an exciting day out to sunny Sentosa on 25 May 2019.  We anticipated about 260 dads and their children participating in this. Today, we saw efforts of our core team of dads, dedication of our Teachers and support from the community serving beyond their responsibilities to enable many more fathers to deepen their bond with their children!There were happy faces, smiles, graciousness as never seen before parents helped each other to 'hunt' and grit as they complete their 'hunt'! Truly our Dads R Awesome!  

4.   Term 3 - Bicentennial @ Fort Canning
