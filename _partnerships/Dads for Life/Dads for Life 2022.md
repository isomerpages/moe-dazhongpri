### Dads For Life 2022

#### DFL Breakfast With Dads 1 cum Badminton Programme

On Sat 2 April, 26 fathers sat down in our school canteen to enjoy a nasi lemak breakfast, followed by an interesting talk by Mr Sri, DFL Core Team member, on 'Unconscious Biases'. Their children had a good warm-up with their peers first before their fathers joined them for an invigorating and joyful badminton session for 90 mins! Then they had the opportunity to sight our students and coaches at their rugby session at the school field! A most inspiring Saturday morning indeed!Â !Join us at our next Dads for Life event soon! DARE to Inspire, Fathers!!

#### DFL Breakfast With Dads 2 cum Hay Dairies Goat Farm Educational Tour

About 25 fathers participated in the breakfast session where they learnt about the 5 core pillars of life, theirs and their children's mindsets or thoughts about daily issues at home or school. They then took the opportunity to interact with their children with regard to how much they know each other during the journey to Hay Dairies.  

  

This was followed by a visit to the Hay Dairies by 70 fathers and their children where they were introduced to the process of milking the goats. The facilitator also spoke about food sustainability in alignment to our school's Applied Learning Programme (ALP). The participants then proceeded to the goat barn to feed the goats. The fathers and their children enjoyed the outing and the requested for more of such outings in future.
