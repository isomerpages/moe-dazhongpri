### Parent Support Group 




We believe when your child joins Dazhong Primary School, your family also becomes a part of  

Dazhong Family. Parents are important partners in enriching their child's learning as parents will know their child best.

  

To facilitate and co-ordinate these partnership with parents, we have a parent support group known

as PSG@Dazhong in our school. Parent support group in Dazhong was set up in 2016. We strongly

believe in engaging our Parents-in-Education to support us in providing a quality and holistic

education to our students and hence positive learning experiences in their primary school years.

PSG@Dazhong is made up of dedicated parents who aim to enhance the education of our children

and to contribute to the development and improvement of all aspects of school life by supporting

the staff of Dazhong in advancing the interests of the school and thereby promoting the well-being

of our students, parents, teachers and community. Our Parents Support group has supported our

school in many ways through school programmes such as Learning Journeys, Reading Mums, Life

Skills programmes, NE &amp; Subject based events, CCAs involvement like Junior Orchestra Morning Buzz, Swimsafer programme, DZPS 80th Anniversary events, co-organising Teacher’s Day and Children’s Day programmes and other school activities.

  

The purpose of the PSG@Dazhong are to:-<br>
\* Develop and promote positive relationships, understanding and communication channel between parents and school;<br>
\* Support the school in both STs; Academic and Non-Academic to value-add students’ learning and promote the image of the school.<br>
