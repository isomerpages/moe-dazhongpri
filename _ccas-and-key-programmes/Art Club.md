<p><strong>CCA Overview</strong>
<br>The Art Club nurtures creativity and imagination through a wide variety
of hands-on art experiences. Students get to explore a range of media from
drawing, painting, printmaking, and mixed media, while learning about local
and international artists to expand their artistic knowledge and expression.</p>
<p>The club also offers a space for students to express themselves, build
confidence, and develop their artistic skills. Through both individual
and group projects, members learn how visual art can communicate ideas
and stories.</p>
<p>Art Club students have the opportunity to contribute actively to school-wide
initiatives such as festive displays, mural projects, DZPS Open House illustrations,
and school library decorations. They also participate in external platforms
like the biennial SYF Art Exhibition and community art projects.</p>
