### Wushu

**CCA Overview**

The Dazhong Wushu Team was set up in 2013 and our members undergoes basic movements training (stances, kicks, punches, balances, jumps, sweeps and throws) first before being taught to perform routines such as chang quan(长拳), sword(剑),  broadsword(刀)，spear(枪) , cudgel(棍) and Southern Broadsword-Nan Dao(南刀). Through Wushu, we aspire to incorporate in our students the values of Excellence and Perseverance.
