<h4>DZPS Guests</h4>
<p>To prepare our students to be Citizens of the future, Dazhong Primary
School focuses on harnessing international partnerships. Our students are
given opportunities to travel on twinning and cultural immersion programmes
and as much as we send students out into the world, we also bring the world
to our doorstep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have hosted many guests from different countries who are interested
in finding out more about our school&nbsp; and our curriculum. Hosting
guests and visitors with different cultures have definitely benefited our
students and enriched them with learning that is beyond their classrooms.</p>
