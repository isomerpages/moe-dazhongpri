### Brownies

**CCA Overview**

In Dazhong Primary School, Brownies are given opportunities to learn various new skills (e.g. sewing and craftwork) and challenged to adventurous activities that will inspire them to think about what they want to be and do in the future. 

Brownies learn to work and play independently and in teams. On special occasions, Brownies participate in joint learning adventures with other Brownie or Girl Guide units. 

Badges are awarded to Brownies who complete the tasks listed in the Badge test-work from the Singapore Girl Guides Association. In addition, they also participate in Special activities and events throughout the year such as World Thinking Day, National Revel, West Division Day, and the Annual Fundraising Cookies Sales Project.
