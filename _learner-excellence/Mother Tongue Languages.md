### Mother Tongue Languages

![](/images/MT%2001.png)

#### Vision

Developing effective bilingual communicators

#### Mission

To nurture self-directed learners who can exercise metacognitive reflection on own learning and seek self-improvement, to become proficient users of their respective Mother Tongue Languages (MTLs).

#### Key Approaches

**Excite:** In the MTL classrooms, students’ learning will be activated, so that they are excited, aware and eager to learn.

**Engage:** Students are engaged to learn actively as they enjoy and learn optimally with their teachers and peers in seamless Blended Learning experiences.

**Empower:** Students are empowered to own and self-direct their MTL learning based on their readiness and interest. They can also use and apply acquired MTL content and skills to serve and advocate for the causes they believe in (e.g. ALP – GreenMakers@Dazhong), and leading their peers, school and the community to be part of the movement. All of which are anchored on strong school and CCE values.
