### Mother Tongue Languages

![](/images/MT%2001.png)

#### Vision

Developing effective bilingual communicators

#### Mission

To nurture self-directed learners who can exercise metacognitive reflection on own learning and seek self-improvement, to become proficient users of their respective Mother Tongue Languages (MTLs).

#### Key Approaches

**Excite:** In the MTL classrooms, students’ learning will be activated, so that they are excited, aware and eager to learn.

**Engage:** Students are engaged to learn actively as they enjoy and learn optimally with their teachers and peers in seamless Blended Learning experiences.

**Empower:** Students are empowered to own and self-direct their MTL learning based on their readiness and interest. They can also use and apply acquired MTL content and skills to serve and advocate for the causes they believe in (e.g. ALP – GreenMakers@Dazhong), and leading their peers, school and the community to be part of the movement. All of which are anchored on strong school and CCE values.

The school seeks to evoke in pupils a deep interest in the learning of the Mother Tongue language through enabling them to appreciate the beauty of the corresponding culture. The CAP comprises the MTL fortnight activities, Cultural Camp and Cultural Immersion Programme. Through the CAP, pupils are provided with opportunities to be exposed to the different ethnic culture through folk songs, poetry recitation, story-telling based on classics, cultural art such as paper-cutting, knot making, silat and overseas cultural immersion trips. Through these cultural activities, the school seeks to enable the pupils to appreciate the beauty underlying each language and hence enthuse them to further seek to deepen their learning of the language.

  

##### Write With Purpose

Believing that pupils will be motivated to learn if they see the purpose and meaning of learning, the Write with Purpose programme seeks not only to equip with pupils writing skills to be confident writers but also develop in them the love for writing through enabling them to appreciate the purpose of writing. Leveraging the ‘UbD’ framework as a guide, the school achieves this through providing pupils with authentic writing experiences and adopting a spiraling approach to equip pupils with writing skills.

  

##### Oral Communication in Mother Tongue Language

To develop pupils to be confident and effective communicators using the MTL, they will  undergo an oral communication programme, comprising speech and drama and public speaking lessons. Through the speech and drama lessons, the school seeks to encourage the lower primary pupils to use the language, while the upper primary pupils participate in a ‘Public Speaking’ programme to equip them to be confident users of the language.

##### Dazhong Total Curriculum

The school is committed to provide student-centric holistic education driven by values and competencies. It seeks to develop the C2015 outcomes, in particular the sense of curiosity for life-long learning, confidence and co-operation (3Cs) through the Total Curriculum@Dazhong. The Total Curriculum@Dazhong comprises rigorous programmes in academic, arts education, character and citizenship education (CCE), and sports education.

  

##### Academic

The Dazhong Curriculum Design Framework(DCDF) guides the school in the design of its curriculum which seeks to provide a rigourous academic programme that will motivate pupils in their learning through authentic learning experiences. The framework is based on the PETALs(Pedagogy, Learning Experience, Tone of Environment, Assessment, Learning Content and Student-Centricity), with adopting Constructivist Theory of Learning as its key pedagogy to enable pupils to make meaning of their learning, ‘Understanding by Design (Ubd)’ to guide teachers in the selection of content(content knowledge, skills, attitudes) to ensure that concepts are not in silos but enable pupils to see connections to make learning meaningful for them and holistic assessment to maximise pupils’ learning. To ensure that the potential of pupils is maximised, the school provides a differentiated curriculum through the Achievers’ Programme.

  

##### Philosophy

The school believes that pupils can be motivated to learn their Mother Tongue Language if they appreciate and understand their respective culture. Like any language acquisition, Mother Tongue Language must not only be taught but also be caught.

  

The school adopts a multi-pronged approach to enable the pupils to be effective and confident users of the language as well as develop in them a deep appreciation of the culture. This is achieved through providing a structured approach to teaching skills such as writing, authentic learning experiences to make learning meaningful and an environment that enables the language to be caught.

  

##### Joy To Read Programme

The school seeks to enable the pupils to take control of their acquisition of the language and learn the language at their pace through developing in them a love for reading in their MTL as well as equip them with skills to read with understanding. The programme is spiraling in nature, focusing on developing an interest in reading for Primary 1 and 2 pupils, reading with comprehension for Primary 3 to 4 pupils and reading for practical use for Primary 5 and 6.  The Joy To Read Programme provides a platform for all MTL teachers to read together once a week, with the view for teachers to role model the good habit as well as build a culture for reading. The school believes that developing in pupils the habit of and the love for reading will put them in good stead in their acquisition of the language.

##### Mother Tongue Fortnight 1 cum Chinese New Year Celebration 2021

     style="width:80%">
	
The Mother Tongue Fortnight programme (Part 1) commenced on the same week as  Chinese New Year Celebration. From 8 February to 10 February 2021, MTL teachers assigned and went through a pre-celebration SLS package with their students. Through this programme, we hope to enhance students’ awareness of traditional values and cultural practices related to Chinese New Year and the different ethnic groups.  To align with ALP (Green Makers @ Dazhong), we also infused meaningful and purposeful age-appropriate opportunities for real-life application of learning, and provide scope for experimentation, self-discovery and joy of learning. By doing so, we hope that students are aware of the challenges of sustainability and take action to solve it through Maker-projects, at the same time advocating others to do likewise.   

Despite restrictions due to the pandemic, our students were meaningfully engaged in the joyous celebration as we usher in the Year of the Ox. They were involved in a series of classroom activities that are aligned with our Green Makers ALP initiative. 

Students from all levels were involved in a myriad of craft activities such as making Floral Petals, Pussy Willows, Mosaic Art and creating a big portrait as a class.  

**P4 Cultural Camp 2021**

     style="width:80%">

MTL Cultural Camp is one of the platforms to encourage students to appreciate their own language and culture and also have exposure to other MTL and traditional cultures. Last year, we introduced shadow puppet to all P4 students, by learning the basic knowledge about the history and theory of shadow puppet, having live puppet show and doing hands-on activity on making shadow puppets and acting out the character .This event created a conducive environment to promote the usage of MTL and cultural appreciation in an authentic setting.  

  

**Hari Raya Celebration 2021**

     style="width:80%">

Hari Raya Puasa was celebrated during the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) period and  it did not dampen the festivities at Dazhong. The MTL Department teachers prepared an interactive SLS lesson centralising on the school values that were displayed during the fasting month as well as during Hari Raya. The short skits were acted by our own P6 students. The teachers also came together to put up a video, emphasizing on how we can still keep the Hari Raya spirit alive while being displaying responsibility and integrity in observing the Safety Management Measures.  To align with ALP (Green Makers @ Dazhong), we also incorporated meaningful and purposeful age-appropriate activities in our CCE SLS lessons for students where they created their own Hari Raya decorations using recycled materials.  

  

##### West Zone e-OC (Chinese Language)

     style="width:80%">

In this lesson, we aim to help students understand the theme and hidden information from the passage. We integrate ICT, Universal Design for Learning (UDL), and Talk Moves to engage students to think deeply, while catering to different types of learners. Firstly, we use SLS's ITT to allow students to express their understanding of the title (guess the story content). Students can choose to express themselves by recording, drawing, or typing (UDL: Engagement). This is to activate students' prior knowledge. After that, students can choose to play the video, listen to the recording of the text, or simply read the text (UDL: Representation) for the first time. Then, students will vote and discuss using Talk Moves online (UDL: Engagement, UDL: Representation). After that, we used the Mindmap to summarize the discussion. The presentation designed by the teacher will contain pictures and text (UDL: Representation). Next, students will use Menti.com to express their understanding of the theme. Students will then use SLS ITT to answer questions relating to their own experience. Students can choose to express themselves by recording, drawing, or typing. (UDL: Action and Expression). Lastly, teachers will use educational game Blooket to help students consolidate their learning and examine whether students meet the success criteria (UDL: Engagement).

Five of our Primary 5 students (Sivababu Deeptika, 5A, Govindaraj Nikithaa 5A, Rajakumar Rahini 5A, Gundre Daivik Reddy 5A and Kumar Naavalan 5P) participated in a national level Tamil quiz competition, Vasantham Super Kids (கற்க கசடற) organised by MediaCorp Vasantham in December 2020 and have done our school proud by emerging as 1st Runner-up in this competition.  

This is an informative reality show based quiz which aims to be an all-round development for the children.
