#### Chinese Language  

##### Dazhong Total Curriculum

The school is committed to provide student-centric holistic education driven by values and competencies. It seeks to develop the C2015 outcomes, in particular the sense of curiosity for life-long learning, confidence and co-operation (3Cs) through the Total Curriculum@Dazhong. The Total Curriculum@Dazhong comprises rigorous programmes in academic, arts education, character and citizenship education (CCE), and sports education.

  

##### Academic

The Dazhong Curriculum Design Framework(DCDF) guides the school in the design of its curriculum which seeks to provide a rigourous academic programme that will motivate pupils in their learning through authentic learning experiences. The framework is based on the PETALs(Pedagogy, Learning Experience, Tone of Environment, Assessment, Learning Content and Student-Centricity), with adopting Constructivist Theory of Learning as its key pedagogy to enable pupils to make meaning of their learning, ‘Understanding by Design (Ubd)’ to guide teachers in the selection of content(content knowledge, skills, attitudes) to ensure that concepts are not in silos but enable pupils to see connections to make learning meaningful for them and holistic assessment to maximise pupils’ learning. To ensure that the potential of pupils is maximised, the school provides a differentiated curriculum through the Achievers’ Programme.

  

##### Philosophy

The school believes that pupils can be motivated to learn their Mother Tongue Language if they appreciate and understand their respective culture. Like any language acquisition, Mother Tongue Language must not only be taught but also be caught.

  

The school adopts a multi-pronged approach to enable the pupils to be effective and confident users of the language as well as develop in them a deep appreciation of the culture. This is achieved through providing a structured approach to teaching skills such as writing, authentic learning experiences to make learning meaningful and an environment that enables the language to be caught.

  

##### Joy To Read Programme

The school seeks to enable the pupils to take control of their acquisition of the language and learn the language at their pace through developing in them a love for reading in their MTL as well as equip them with skills to read with understanding. The programme is spiraling in nature, focusing on developing an interest in reading for Primary 1 and 2 pupils, reading with comprehension for Primary 3 to 4 pupils and reading for practical use for Primary 5 and 6.  The Joy To Read Programme provides a platform for all MTL teachers to read together once a week, with the view for teachers to role model the good habit as well as build a culture for reading. The school believes that developing in pupils the habit of and the love for reading will put them in good stead in their acquisition of the language.

  

##### Cultural Appreciation Programme (CAP)

The school seeks to evoke in pupils a deep interest in the learning of the Mother Tongue language through enabling them to appreciate the beauty of the corresponding culture. The CAP comprises the MTL fortnight activities, Cultural Camp and Cultural Immersion Programme. Through the CAP, pupils are provided with opportunities to be exposed to the different ethnic culture through folk songs, poetry recitation, story-telling based on classics, cultural art such as paper-cutting, knot making, silat and overseas cultural immersion trips. Through these cultural activities, the school seeks to enable the pupils to appreciate the beauty underlying each language and hence enthuse them to further seek to deepen their learning of the language.

  

##### Write With Purpose

Believing that pupils will be motivated to learn if they see the purpose and meaning of learning, the Write with Purpose programme seeks not only to equip with pupils writing skills to be confident writers but also develop in them the love for writing through enabling them to appreciate the purpose of writing. Leveraging the ‘UbD’ framework as a guide, the school achieves this through providing pupils with authentic writing experiences and adopting a spiraling approach to equip pupils with writing skills.

  

##### Oral Communication in Mother Tongue Language

To develop pupils to be confident and effective communicators using the MTL, they will  undergo an oral communication programme, comprising speech and drama and public speaking lessons. Through the speech and drama lessons, the school seeks to encourage the lower primary pupils to use the language, while the upper primary pupils participate in a ‘Public Speaking’ programme to equip them to be confident users of the language.
