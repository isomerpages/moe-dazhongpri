### Mother Tongue Languages

![](/images/MT%2001.png)

#### Vision

Developing effective bilingual communicators

#### Mission

To nurture self-directed learners who can exercise metacognitive reflection on own learning and seek self-improvement, to become proficient users of their respective Mother Tongue Languages (MTLs).

#### Key Approaches

**Excite:** In the MTL classrooms, students’ learning will be activated, so that they are excited, aware and eager to learn.

**Engage:** Students are engaged to learn actively as they enjoy and learn optimally with their teachers and peers in seamless Blended Learning experiences.

**Empower:** Students are empowered to own and self-direct their MTL learning based on their readiness and interest. They can also use and apply acquired MTL content and skills to serve and advocate for the causes they believe in (e.g. ALP – GreenMakers@Dazhong), and leading their peers, school and the community to be part of the movement. All of which are anchored on strong school and CCE values.

![](/images/MT%2012.jpg)<br>
The MTFP Part 1 cum 2022 CNY Celebrations was organized by the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department. 

In 2022, the programme was designed, in collaboration with other departments, with age-appropriate activities that were aligned to the school’s new focus and directions. Students were engaged and empowered to put into action their will to support a sustainable environment, while learning about the cultural aspects of CNY.<br>
During the four-day programme (26 to 31 Jan 2022), the Cultural (Art) Appreciation activities during MTL lessons and eve of CNY, students made handicrafts with recycled materials, via SLS lesson packages.<br>
Through these activities, students exhibited self-directed learning, responsibility and acceptance. Their perseverance and aim for excellence led them to create creative artifacts.<br>
Students also had opportunities to exhibit the attributes of being concerned citizens and serving leaders for the community, by participating in the fundraising for the Lions Clubs of Singapore.


Mother Tongue Fortnight Programme (MTFP) 2022<br>
MTFP Part 2 - Racial Harmony Day

![](/images/MT%2013.jpg)<br>
The objective of the 2022 MTL Fortnight Part 2 programme was to develop appreciation and love for learning one’s Mother Tongue Language.

The school celebrated Racial Harmony by learning more about traditional art, cultivating students’ understanding of the cultural stories behind the traditional art, and applying MTL language to celebrate the cultural diversity in Singapore. We also wanted to celebrate the diversity of ethnic cultures and emphasize the importance of Racial Harmony Day. This will serve to enhance our school Racial Harmony and cultural interaction index.<br>
We also hoped that besides understanding and appreciating their own culture and language, our students would be more motivated to love and care for our environment too.

**Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES) 2022**

Under CPES (CL), schools can choose Chinese performances suitable for students from the recommended plays. Students can go out of school and enter the theatre to enrich their theatre experience, so that students can feel the charm of Chinese theatre and experience the beauty of culture and Chinese.<br>
Our school seeks to evoke in pupils a deep interest in the learning of the Mother Tongue language through enabling them to appreciate the beauty of cultural performances. Through CPES, pupils are provided with opportunities to be exposed to the different ethnic cultures through folk songs, poetry recitation, storytelling based on classics, theatre experiences etc. Through these cultural activities, the school seeks to enable the pupils to appreciate the beauty underlying each language and hence enthuse them to further seek to deepen their learning of the language.

For CPES (ML), the Malay Language students had the opportunity to learn about the rich cultural heritage of the Malay community through an Angklung performance and learning to play the instrument.<br>
The students were introduced to the unique Malay musical instrument made of bamboos. They learnt that a performance will not do with only a single Angklung player as the instrument produces only a singular note on its own. Through this interactive programme, the students not only learn to appreciate Angklung music better by playing the instrument in a hands-on session, they also learnt the beauty of team work as they produce harmonious melodies as a group.
