### Art

**Our DZ Visual Arts Programmes**

At P3, the students learn about paper-mache sculpting in which they are equipped with the basic techniques and skills to create artwork using recycled bottle based; inspired by the Cheong Soo Pieng’s _Drying Salted Fish._ To learn more about Singapore pioneer artist, Mr Cheong, click **[here](https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/7-things-to-know-about-singapore-pioneer-artist-cheong-soo-pieng)**.

**Museum-based learning at National Gallery**

Our school planned an integrated Art and Social Studies learning journey to the National Gallery for our Primary 4 students. This museum-based learning was also part of the new Primary 4 Art syllabus. 

During the learning journey, students had the opportunity to tour the National Gallery to learn about the stories behind a number of artworks by Singapore pioneer artists and talk about their observations and interpretations. They also learn to appreciate the relationship between art and history and acquire critical thinking skills through group discussions and activities.

**Caricature Challenge**  

An Art Assembly Programme on Live Caricatures was conducted for the whole school. Students learnt some quick cartooning and caricature techniques from Doodlemaster Einstein Kristiansen through his videos, get to do live doodling on stage and participated in Caricature Challenge during Art lessons.

In the challenge, a random line was given and our students were to gather inspiration from the doodles, cartooning and caricature techniques from the video shown during the assembly. They were given about a week to complete their design in school or at home. The best 3 pieces per level have been selected by our Art teachers and were awarded attractive prizes!
