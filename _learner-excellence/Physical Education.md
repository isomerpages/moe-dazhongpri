#### PHYSICAL EDUCATION & CO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES (PE, CCA & AESTHETICS) DEPARTMENT


#### PHILOSOPHY

We believe that human movement develops pupils' maximum physical potential and their related social, emotional, and intellectual growth. As such, every pupil gets to participate in a variety of sports and outdoor camping activities.


#### Overview of PE Programme

The school’s PE programme seeks to develop pupils into a physically educated child with a love for sports and the outdoors. By this, we hope pupils will acquire the necessary knowledge, skills and attitudes that will enable them to lead a healthy lifestyle.

  

In addition to learning skills related to Athletics, Health & Fitness, Sports, Educational Gymnastics and Dance in the PE curriculum, pupils also get to participate in a variety of activities under the “Opportunities For All” Programmes.

#### Key Programmes

Our Health Education Department aims to empower our pupils with the necessary knowledge and skills for them to take care of their health and the health of others, including their environment.  The pupils are taught how to practise good health habits and exhibit socially responsible behaviour.

  

Pupils will be engaged in a variety of learning experiences through heath activities, assembly talks, project work, health-related competitions and the various health promotion programmes to learn how to take care of others and themselves.

Below are some of our health initiatives:

#### Objectives:

Our pupils will be able to:

  

##### Physical Health

1\. Learn that good health habits will contribute to healthy growth and development of the body, e.g. practising good nutrition, hygiene and through regular exercise;

  

2\. Exhibit good health habits in their daily lives;

  
##### Mental Health

3\. Use social skills for effective interaction among themselves (.e.g to build friendship and resolve conflicts)

  

#### Physical Health Promotion

##### CNB Anti-Drug Ambassador Programme

All Primary Four and Five pupils will participate in this programme which aims to promote a greater understanding of the dangers of drug abuse and encourage peer sharing among our pupils. This also serves to strengthen the level of involvement between parents and teachers.

  

##### We are Active School Programme

The programme serves to increase the level of physical activity participation among pupils through classroom lessons and recess activities.

  

##### Health Exhibitions

Through these exhibitions, pupils learn how to make healthier choices for their diet. They learn about the importance of nutrition and healthy-eating from participating in the health-promotion activities.

  

#### Oral Health Promotion

##### Oral Health Programme
