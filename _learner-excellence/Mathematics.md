Mathematics Department Vision, Mission and Key Approches

**Mission**:

To nurture self-directed, thinking individuals with a passion and love for Mathematics learning and problem-solving.

**Key Approaches:**

●        To develop students’ competencies in Maths problem-solving holistically using the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract approach. \[Engage\]

●        To engage students in the learning of Mathematics and to promote the love for Mathematics learning through authentic learning experiences. \[Engage/Excite\]

●        To empower Maths learners to be self-directed learners through timely feedback of their learning, and differentiated and timely support for different student segments. \[Empower\]

Mathematics in Dazhong is shaped by our direction of Mastery of Maths for Life. This takes place in two ways: (1) Cultivating the Joy of Learning, and (2) Building Confidence through Mastery. Along this direction, key milestone programmes are designed to promote conceptual understanding by sense-making through stories.

The broad aims of Mathematics education in Dazhong are aligned to that of the National curriculum. They are to enable students to:

\-  acquire & apply mathematical concepts & skills;

\-  develop cognitive & metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem solving; &

 -  develop positive attitudes towards Mathematics.

**Authentic learning experiences**: In line with our Mathematics Department’s approach of promoting the love for Mathematics learning through authentic learning experiences and our belief that our students learn best through purposeful play, we provide a wide range of learning experiences for students in our Mathematics classrooms. For instance, when teaching the topic of ‘Angles’ to middle-primary students, we provide our students with opportunities to find angles in the environment and use a ‘paper right angle’ to identify right angles, obtuse angles and acute angles.

**_George Polya’s 4-Step Approach to Problem Solving_**: The S.T.E.P Thinking Routine was adopted from George Polya’s four-step approach for problem solving. It was intentionally created to scaffold our students’ critical and problem solving skills when tackling heuristics and problem sums. Students will make use of the four steps in the S.T.E.P Thinking Routine when solving Mathematics problems – **S**tudy the problem, **T**hink of a plan, **E**xecute the plan, **P**ause and reflect. The steps emphasize 4 key principles:

\-        Understand the problem<br>
\-        Devise a plan<br>
\-        Carry out the plan<br>
\-        Review/Extend

The S.T.E.P Thinking Routine is incorporated into the design of our Progressive Approach to Teaching Heuristic and Skills (P.A.T.H.S) Package, a termly package that introduces two or three heuristic skills to students progressively.  


To develop our students to acquire and apply the necessary skills, concepts, processes, attitudes and metacognition towards learning Mathematics, the department carefully designs and plans suitable learning experiences (LEs) both in and out of the classroom. Such LEs help students to activate their learning and promote critical and inventive thinking. At suitable milestone checkpoints, we assess and monitor their learning.

Department Key Principles & Programmes

The department teaching principles are aligned to the Singapore Teaching Practice. The key principles:

1.        Teaching is for learning; learning is for understanding; understanding is for reasoning and applying and ultimately problem solving.<br>
2.        Teaching should build on students’ knowledge; being cognisant of students’ interests and experiences; and engage them in active & reflective learning.<br>
3.        Teaching should connect learning to the real world, harness ICT tools & emphasize 21st century competencies. 

Teaching is an interactive and iterative process that is focused on students’ learning. Teachers use a range of teaching approaches to engage students in learning, collect various sources of feedback to inform them of their instruction and the students’ learning, and then make informed decisions on their instructional practices to enhance learning.

Our key pedagogical approaches include:

**Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract Approach:** The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) Approach engages our students in the process of deep and active learning and the mastery of mathematical concepts and skills in our classrooms. Students participate in activities involving the use of concrete materials and pictorial representations or diagrams to acquire full conceptual understanding in Mathematics, moving through the three stages – enactive, iconic and symbolic – as posited in a research-based Theory of Cognitive Development by Jerome Bruner.
