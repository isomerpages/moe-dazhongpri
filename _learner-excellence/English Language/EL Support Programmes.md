### EL Support Programmes

##### Key Programmes

The various school-wide reading programmes ensure that every Dazhong pupil is a reader today, ready to succeed tomorrow.

  

##### Joy to Read

Reading is fundamental to building pupils’ language.  Therefore, 30 minutes is set aside every week for the whole school to engage in the pleasure of reading an English book. Classrooms are stocked with age-appropriate materials to create an environment conducive for reading and learning.

  

##### Read to Achieve (ReAch) Programme – P1 and P2

Recognising that our P1 and P2 pupils come in at different entry levels, the P1 and P2 ReAch programme serves 3 broad categories of readers to achieve 3 different objectives:

*   To level up ‘struggling’ readers;
*   To improve fluency and strengthen phonemic awareness of the average pupils;
*   To expose proficient readers to richer and longer texts and engage them in critical thinking

#### Enrichment Programmes

**Literature Programme (P1 to P6)**

(a module of Arts Education Programme)

  

Through the Literature programme, we inspire our pupils by introducing to them the works of good writers while equipping them with different “lenses” to examine and appreciate texts.  Writers’ craft and intentions are discussed and pupils are guided to read critically.

  

Taking the read text to the next level, P1 to P5 pupils would translate their understanding and appreciation of the text to a dramatic portrayal of the book.

| Level 	| Genre 	|
|:---:	|:---:	|
| P1 	| Fables, fairy tales and children’s classics 	|
| P2 	| Pourquoi tales, autobiographies and children’s classics 	|
| P3 	| Children’s literature 	|
| P4 	| Folk tale, adventure, comedy 	|
| P5 	| Realistic contemporary fiction 	|
| P6 	| Realistic contemporary fiction 	|

**Speech and Drama (P1 to P5) and  Oral Communication Skills (P6)**

All P1 to P5 pupils attend 12 hours of Speech and Drama lessons during curriculum culminating to a performance to showcase what they have learnt.  Through Speech and Drama lessons, pupils develop confidence and effective oral communication skills. Creativity, imagination and critical thinking are also harnessed.
