### About MK

MOE Kindergarten (MK) provides quality and affordable preschool education to Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents aged 5 and 6. Learn about it and whether it’s right for your child.  
  
**MOE Kindergarten @ Dazhong** was set up within Dazhong Primary School in January 2014. The kindergarten provides K1 and K2 programmes. Dazhong Primary School partners MOE Kindergarten @ Dazhong closely to enrich the learning experiences of our pupils and the kindergarten children.   
  
What is MOE Kindergarten  

We started MOE Kindergarten (MK) to provide quality and affordable Kindergarten 1 (K1) and Kindergarten 2 (K2) education to Singapore Citizens (SC) and Permanent Residents (PR) .

Our [curriculum and programmes](https://www.moe.gov.sg/preschool/moe-kindergarten/curriculum) focus on:

*   Holistic development.
*   Integrated and active learning.
*   Learning through purposeful play and quality interactions.
*   Developing confidence and social skills.
*   Building a good foundation in literacy and numeracy.
*   Nurturing bilingualism through learning activities in both English and Mother Tongue Language (i.e. Chinese, Malay and Tamil languages).


#### Vision, Mission & Values


Our vision is to provide a strong start for every child. We seek to do so through providing quality pre-school education that is affordable to Singaporeans and catalysing quality improvements in the sector.

We nurture children holistically so that they are confident, demonstrate strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy.
