### Brownies

**CCA Overview**

The Brownies 1st pack consists of 32 Brownies and 37 Tweenies (P3-P6). Our pack meetings are held every Tuesday from 7:40am to 9:40am.

Dazhong Primary School, Brownies are given opportunities to learn various new skills (e.g. sewing and craftwork) and challenged to adventurous activities that will inspire them to think about what they want to be and do in the future. 

Brownies learn to work and play independently and in teams. On special occasions, Brownies participate in joint learning adventures with other Brownie or Girl Guide units. 

Badges are awarded to Brownies who complete the tasks listed in the Badge test-work from the Singapore Girl Guides Association. In addition, they also participate in Special activities and events throughout the year such as World Thinking Day, National Revel, West Division Day, and the Annual Fundraising Cookies Sales Project.


**Achievements and Events**

**West Division Day (WDD) 2021** <br>The Dazhong Brownies took part in several asynchronous competitions during WDD. One of the competitions ‘Get Creative with TikTok’ allowed the girls to exercise their creativity for a good cause, promoting Peacebuilding. The other competition was ‘Caption the Moment’. The girls had to capture an image which embodied the theme for ‘Girl for Sustainable Development Goals – Peacebuilding’. Our Brownies received the Silver Award for both.

**Puan Noor Aishah Award (PNA)**  

Our Brownies (Dazhong Primary 1st Pack) have been awarded the Puan Noor Aishah Award (Gold) for their achievements in 2018.

The PNA Award is presented annually to outstanding packs that have successfully fulfilled the criteria set by Girl Guides Singapore. These include participation in division and national activities and competition, community involvement and the attainment of Proficiency Badges.

**World Thinking Day (WTD) Carnival  2019**

 Dazhong Brownies joined forces with De La Salle Brownies to set up a Pokemon-themed bowling stall in the WTD carnival. The stall comprised of plastic bottles, reused balls, cardboard pieces and uncooked rice to make the stall as environmentally-friendly as possible. The Brownies were assigned specific tasks before and during the carnival which they had to be responsible over. During the carnival, each school manned the game stall for 4 hours and did their best to drum up the sales by persuading carnival-goers and walking around advertising the game stall. This event also gave them the opportunity to showcase and practise their leadership and entrepreneurial skills. Kudos to the Brownies.

 **World Thinking Day Dance Competition 2019 (Girls Got Talent-Champion)**

Besides setting up the game stall, three Brownies took part in ‘Girls Got Talent’ Finals and they came in first place based on the public votes. They had to juggle both school work and dance practice sessions. They also came up with the dance on their own.

They were self-directed and exhibited both responsibility and excellence.

Our Brownies took part in the recent West Division Day Competition 2019 held at Fuhua Primary School. This is an annual event where Brownies from various schools are given the opportunity to interact with one another through fun-filled games and activities planned by Girl Guides Singapore. The friendly competitions created a platform for the Brownies to exchange knowledge and skills, to be gracious and to be prepared to serve with confidence.
