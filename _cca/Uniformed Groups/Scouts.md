**About Cub Scouts**

<img src="/images/ug10.png" style="width:80%">

Scouting was first established in 1907 with the intent of making the world a better place through the education of our young people. The Scout Promise and Law serves as a moral compass for our Scouts, guiding them to be constructive members of the society who are deeply rooted in values.

Cub scouts, forming the youngest group of the global Scouting family, partake in indoor and outdoor training sessions that will equip them with the necessary technical skills to be self-reliant, supportive, responsible and committed individuals who are always prepared to help other people. The core skills learnt by cub scouts can be broadly classified into four major categories:

·         Navigation<br>
·         Campcrafting<br>
·         Outdoor cooking<br>
·         Hiking and Trail-Making

Cub scouts also constantly improve their repertoire of other skills through a balance of adult guidance and self-directed learning. Every skill learnt by a cub scout is recognised through the earning of a corresponding skill badge, which also signifies the capacity of the cub scout to help other people.
