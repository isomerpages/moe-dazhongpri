### Badminton

**CCA Overview**

In line with the CCA mission of nurturing the talents and interests of children in the Sports, the Badminton Club aims to impart skills and strategies related to the sport of badminton to the students so that they can play and enjoy badminton. This will give students the opportunity to pursue badminton as one option of recreational physical activities. 

For students who show a higher aptitude to badminton, they will be given extra training that will allow them to play and participate at higher competitive level such as the National School Games.

We also believe that through learning about and through badminton, students will be given the opportunity to display the school values and the Pupils Outcomes Standards. It is through these opportunities that our students can achieve the schoolâ€™s vision of self-directed learners, serving leaders and concerned citizens.


**CCA Schedule**<br>
Badminton training for all club members will be during curriculum time i.e., Tuesdays from 7.40am to 9.40am.<br>
Additional trainings for the school team and potential school team members will be on Thursdays, 2.10pm to 4.10pm.

The club will also organise holiday training sessions for students.

**Teachers-in-Charge:**<br>
Mr Syahriel (IC)<br>

In 2022, our P6 boys participated in the National School Games Badminton Senior Boys Competition. Although we did not get through the preliminary stages, our boys put up a gallant fight and made the school proud.

Our junior team also participated in the NSG Junior Competition. There was a change in the format for 2022 where players played in 2 rounds i.e., preliminaries and the tiered rounds. Gabriel from 5A achieved first place in his group with the other junior team members achieving reasonable results in their respective groups.
