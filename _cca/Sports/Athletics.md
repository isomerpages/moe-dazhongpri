### Athletics

**CCA Overview**

The Athletics CCA focuses on various variety of Track and field events, ranging from the 100m, to the long jump and Shot Put. We believe that each Tracker is unique in terms of their potential and aspiration. Thus, a myriad of opportunities will be provided for individuals to find their own footing. 

The aim of our CCA does not stop at winning medals, but to inculcate and impart values that allows them to grow as a Serving leader and Concerned citizen. Adding on, the trainings are designed to build student’s mental and physical strength.
