### Basketball

**CCA Overview**

*“The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team.” – Phil Jackson, American former professional basketball player.*

With the above quote, we believe that every member in the team is important and have their own strengths in their own ways. Dazhong Basketball aims to provide students with the opportunity to grow to become Self-Directed Learners, Concerned Citizens and Serving Leaders. 

In Dazhong Basketball, students work in teams to practice their attack and defence strategies and learn to tap on one another’s strengths and weaknesses to build on one another. They would also learn basic basketball skills like ball handling and shooting techniques. To develop students to be serving leaders, students are given leadership opportunities to lead the team in team bonding games, trainings, and logistical management. 

To build and develop character, we also highlight teachable moments with students to further exemplify the school values of **IREAP (Integrity, Responsibility, Excellence, Acceptance and Perseverance)**.
