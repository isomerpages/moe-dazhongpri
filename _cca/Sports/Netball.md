### Netball

★  **Introduction**

 Our DZPS Netball Team provides numerous **opportunities** for the girls to grow by competing hard and vigorously. Many precious and life-long lessons are acquired along the way. Some of these include sporting values such as **fair-play**, **resilience**, **teamwork**, **sportsmanship** and **respect**.

These values and lessons will be acquired by the various platforms provided (_see table below_) such as taking part in several other **friendly games**, **tournaments** and **carnivals** throughout the year. Not only their skills and techniques will be strengthened, these platforms will further develop the girls in the 21st century competencies such as growing to be confident players and building new friendships within the team itself and other school teams (social interaction).

The highlight of this year will be the West Zone Primary School Netball Championships that the senior girls (P6) had participated. They had made the school proud by achieving 3rd placing (Top 4 in the West Zone) and they were qualified to proceed to the National rounds. Hurray! They have fought very hard till the very last second in every game despite facing strong competitions such as CHIJ OLQP, Methodist Girls’ School and Henry Park Primary School.

Netball provides numerous opportunities for the girls to grow by competing hard and vigorously. Many precious and life-long lessons are acquired along the way. Some of these include sporting values such as fair-play, resilience, team-work and respect.

★       **Reflections** from the students on what they have gained from the CCA  

 **Chyi Ann, P5 / Integrity**

_“I have learnt the value of perseverance. During netball trainings, I often have difficulties  
learning new techniques. I also learnt how to make new friends that I would love to treasure.”_

**Yen Ning-Yo, P5 / Integrity**  

_“I have learnt to be a resilient player and persevere even when I feel very pressurised and intimidated by the opponent’s strength. I have also made stronger bonds with my teammates as we have gone through a lot together!”_

 **Ding Ming Hui, P5 / Acceptance**

_“I have made more friends in netball that I want to keep for long. I have learnt to persevere and not to give up easily.”_

**Joycelin, P5 / Acceptance**

_“‘Never say die - Energizer battery!’ Whenever I find myself struggling, I keep telling myself to strive on. I have wonderful netball fighters in the team who will always encourage me. They are friends whom I can count on.”_
