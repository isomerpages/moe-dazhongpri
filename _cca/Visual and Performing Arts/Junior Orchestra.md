**Dazhong Junior Orchestra** 

Dazhong Primary School is the only Primary School in Singapore to have a full Junior Orchestra. At present, the members of the Orchestra stand at 91 members strong. The Junior Orchestra is an extension of our String Ensemble (violin) Music Programme for our P1 – P3 students who have shown an aptitude and interest in the performing arts. The Junior Orchestra serves to further hone their skills and strengthen their passion in this field. 

The collaboration between Dazhong and Arts Education Branch started in 2016 and Dazhong Primary School’s Junior Orchestra was set up in October 2016. It was named 'Inspiratum' which means 'The Inspired' in partnership with MOE Arts Education Branch.  

Dazhong Primary School seeks to develop in our pupils the following through the JO programme in collaboration with MOE AEB: 

\- Self-directed learning disposition through a love and passion for music and performing arts; <br>
\- Graciousness through relationship management learning & collaborative skills development and team work <br>
\- Resilience through self-management and discipline and confidence; <br>
\- Serving Beyond self through musical skills  

  
With the development of JO curriculum at Dazhong Primary, our pupils are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to explore further their interests in the various fields of Instrumental Playing and in their secondary school of choice or through DSA. Some of our students also been identified for SOTA awards. Students were given opportunities to participate in school and community events, collaboration with schools, perform at community or national level. 

With the partnership from MOE AEB, our school also collaborated with Methodist Girls’ School in 2018 and 2019. MGS students have inspired our students with their talents and skills in music making. MGS students were given opportunity to mentor our Dazhong students. Our students benefited from this collaboration with MGS as it has helped them to become more confident, more focus and more discipline to do well even in their studies. 

Partnership with MOE AEB have also brought about great exposure and experience for our Dazhong JO students. We have outreach community performances at National Gallery on 30 June 2018 where Minister of Education (Ong Ye Kung) & DGE came to support the National Gallery performance. Our students were also given opportunity to perform at National Day Observance Ceremony at MOE HQ (Buona Vista) on 7 August 2018. Collaboration with MGS also brought us to the next level where our students were given an opportunity to perform at SDP 7th President Charity Show on 17 March 2019 and also SYF Arts Celebration organised by MOE AEB. Collaborative Dazhong JO with MGS performance will be held at Kampung Admiralty on 7 August 2019.   

To create opportunities for JO members to perform for within school and outside school, Junior Orchestra have performed during Prize Giving Day, National Day Celebration, Break-time Concerts and public performances 80 Anniversary Musical Concert.

Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2022 – Percussion Ensemble On 17 August 2022, the Percussion players from our Dazhong Primary School Junior Orchestra took part in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2022 – Percussion Ensemble 🥁. With the Choice Piece ‘Marcha-Cumbia’ by Stephen Tillapaugh, the students’ impactful and enchanting performance tugged at the heartstrings of the audience present at the Republic Cultural Centre, Republic Polytechnic. Through this musical journey, our self-directed and resilient Junior Orchestra students 👨‍🎓 exemplified our IREAP values, practising tirelessly, in school and at home, for the past four months to deliver this stellar performance at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2022 – a testament to their love and passion for music and the performing arts! Through this musical journey, they have certainly gained deeper knowledge in musical skills, instrumental techniques and performance etiquette, becoming more self-directed, gracious, confident, motivated and engaged musicians and serving leaders! 🎼🎶🎵 Dazhong, Dare to Inspire! 🤗
