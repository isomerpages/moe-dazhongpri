### Junior Orchestra

**CCA Overview**

Dazhong Primary School is currently the only primary school in Singapore offering a full Junior Orchestra (JO). At present, the members of the Orchestra stand at 91 members strong. One of the key aims of this programme is to uplift students through music and by providing opportunities that they may not have access to.

Junior Orchestra is an extension of the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) and is part of the Arts Education Programme@Dazhong (AEP@Dazhong). As part of AEP, all Primary 1 to 3 students go through the String Ensemble (violin) music programme. Students who show an aptitude and interest in the performing arts are invited to further develop their skills and deepen their passion through JO. The JO programme has brought about positive outcomes for our students. They are more attuned to their social and emotional competencies and their self-efficacy has seen positive growth.
 Our Junior Orchestra students had performed in many outreach community platforms like at Hong Kah North Community Club National Day events, National Gallery, SYF Arts Presentation as well as President Charity Show. Our students are featured in Lian He Zao Bao as well as Suria TV. 

**Objectives of Dazhong Junior Orchestra:**
* Provide interested students who cannot afford private instrumental lessons the opportunities to learn music;
* Engage under-privileged and at-risk students meaningfully in musical and orchestral activities;
* Develop students’ self-esteem, discipline, confidence and perseverance; and
* Develop students in social and emotional competencies in the domains of self-management and relationship management skills.

Dazhong Junior Orchestra seeks to build a vibrant arts culture in school and community at large, and to have an inspirational arts environment for our students. 

Our school’s Junior Orchestra seeks to:
* **Excite** and motivate our students to shine and display their musical talents;
* **Engage** our students so that the exposure and experience help them to feel a deeper sense of involvement through their performances to their peers, teachers and important stakeholders; and
* **Empower** our students to be confident performers and active contributors through the arts.


Our school’s Junior Orchestra aims to develop the 3As (Awareness, Action and Advocacy) in our students:
* **Awareness:** Boost students’ confidence and help build greater awareness of music.
* **Action:** Share and perform various repertoire selection, and express and communicate with the audience through performances.
* **Advocacy:** Collaborate with other performers to help tell their stories through music for all to understand and enjoy.



With the development of JO curriculum at Dazhong Primary School, our students are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to explore further their interests in the various fields of instrumental playing and in their secondary school of choice or through Direct School Admission (DSA). Some of our students have also been identified for the SOTA Temasek Foundation Award for Arts Development. Our students have been given opportunities to participate in school and community events, collaborate with other schools, and perform at community and/or national level. 

Dazhong Junior Orchestra has collaborated with Methodist Girls’ School since 2018. The MGS students have inspired our Dazhong students with their talents and skills in music making. MGS students were given the opportunity to mentor our Dazhong students. Our students have benefited from this collaboration with MGS as it has helped them to become more confident, more focused and more disciplined.

In 2023, Dazhong Junior Orchestra collaborates with NUS Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music (NUS YST) through sessions in which YST students are guided towards coaching our Dazhong musicians through their undergraduate module, Orchestral Pedagogy. This culminates in a Children’s Concert in which our JO students perform side by side with YST students in a family-oriented concert at the Conservatory Orchestra Hall at NUS YST.

**Achievements / Peak of Excellence / CCA in Actions**

**Dazhong JO Collaboration with Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music (4 February 2023) - JO 1st series of workshop collaborations with YST@NUS**

Our JO students had a great time learning musicianship knowledge and skills from YST students today. Students will have opportunities to learn from the YST musicians every Saturday and they will be having their final concert performance on 12 March 2023. Great to have parents coming to support this collaboration. Dazhong, Dare to Shine!
