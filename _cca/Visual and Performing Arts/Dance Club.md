### Dance Club

Dazhong Dance Club trains pupils in a broad spectrum of dance genres like the contemporary, modern, ethnic and hiphop dance. A strong set of values is instilled in each and every Dazhong dancer as they embark on their journey and this enables them to discover their potential beyond dance. In order to excel in our passion, Dazhong dancers go the extra mile to prepare themselves. Students also learn to appreciate various types of music and how body movements can be used to enhance and express in the performing arts. In this Dance Art Form, our students develop poise, grace and elegance with confidence.
