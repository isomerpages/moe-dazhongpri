### Dance Club

Dazhong Dance Club trains pupils in a broad spectrum of dance genres like the contemporary, modern, ethnic and hiphop dance. A strong set of values is instilled in each and every Dazhong dancer as they embark on their journey and this enables them to discover their potential beyond dance. In order to excel in our passion, Dazhong dancers go the extra mile to prepare themselves. Students also learn to appreciate various types of music and how body movements can be used to enhance and express in the performing arts. In this Dance Art Form, our students develop poise, grace and elegance with confidence.

The Dance Club also gives the students the opportunity to build character through discipline and responsibility as students take up roles like Dance Leaders and Dance Captains. Through good teamwork and camaraderie, the dancers develop their social emotional skills as they interact with students of different ages and from the various levels.

Our dancers performed for the Lions Club of Singapore NANYANG, 16th Anniversary Dinner.   


Pupils are given opportunity to perform at various school events like Prize Giving and 80th Anniversary Musical Concert. Performances include public events such as performances organised by Hong Kah North CC so as to provide them with a platform to display their talents.
