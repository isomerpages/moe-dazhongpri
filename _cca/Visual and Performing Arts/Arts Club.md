### Arts Club

Dazhong Art Club strives to develop pupils who have a flair for art and design and an eye for the Aesthetics.  

Dazhong Art Club allows pupils with a shared interest in art to gather and create art. Through the weekly sessions, the pupils explore different media such as paint, batik dyes, water colour, oil pastels and mixed media. Our students also learnt brush lettering, explored doodle designs, created 3D art using jumping clay, transformed recycled bottles into flowers use for beautifying the school and composed creative artworks inspired by artists’ styles and techniques. These artworks and projects provide platforms for pupils to enhance their creativity and self-expression, and to gain a greater understanding of concepts and ideas in art.

To add on to their primary school art education experience, Museum learning journeys are organised to raise pupils’ awareness about art around Singapore. Students also learnt more about Singapore’s history and local artists in their art curriculum as well as when they are in their Art Club. In addition, our students read up and get to view original artworks up close as they acquire art vocabulary to express their opinions on art.

To foster greater sense of belonging of Dazhong students with our community, our Art Club students were involved in a community involvement event known as the Passion Arts Festival Village at Hong Kah North Community Centre. This platform was a good experience as we exhibited our Art Club works and our Art Club Student Ambassadors learnt to present our artworks and engage the residents to do an art piece at our art booth.

Art Club gives opportunities for our students to take part in art competitions and activities because we strongly believe that these are platforms for our students to gain valuable experiences that would benefit them in the future. Through the various arts experiences created, we hope to develop in our students an appreciation of the arts and providing a platform for our students to build confidence as budding artists in the making.
