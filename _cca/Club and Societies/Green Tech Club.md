### Green Tech Club

Climate change, the depletion of fossil fuel, and rapid urbanization are driving countries to use greener and more sustainable solutions. This presents strong incentives in the global economy for entrepreneurship, research and development (R&D) and creative problem solving to adapt to this greener landscape.

  

Our Prime Minister, Mr Lee Hsien Loong highlighted during National Day Rally in 2019,

  

"Climate change may seem abstract and distant for many of us. But it is one of the gravest challenges facing humankind... So what can we do? Three things: understand climate change, mitigate climate change, and adapt to climate change.‚Äù

  

To help our students ride on this global wave, our Green Tech Club members will be applying these computational thinking and problem solving skills to green problems in the world. To problem solve and design solutions, students will be brought through the Design Thinking Process of Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. Students learn how to collaboratively work in groups to create their solutions using micro:bits and Boson Inventor kits.
