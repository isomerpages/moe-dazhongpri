<p><strong>Did you know?</strong>
</p>
<p>Established in 2014, we are proud to be one of the first five MOE Kindergartens
set up to provide families with accessible and quality preschool education.
Over the past decade, we have grown alongside our children and families,
remaining committed to nurturing confident learners and building strong
foundations for lifelong learning.</p>
<p><strong>Our Vision, Mission and Values</strong>
</p>
<p>On to a strong start for every child at MK@Dazhong!</p>
<p>We do so by providing quality preschool education that is affordable to
Singaporean families, while catalysing quality improvements across the
sector.</p>
<p>At MOE Kindergarten, we believe that children are joyful, curious, active
and competent learners. We nurture children holistically to build confidence,
develop strong social skills, and establish a strong foundation in literacy
and numeracy. Our teaching and learning practices are guided by the Vision,
Mission and Values of MOE Kindergarten.</p>
