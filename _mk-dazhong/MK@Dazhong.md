Dear K2 Parents,  
  
Join Us for our DZPS Community Day & Eco Carnival 2023!

  
Dazhong Primary School cordially invites you to join us for our upcoming 85th Anniversary cum Community Day & Eco Carnival.

For the Kindergarteners, we have the #**G**r**e**en**M**akers booths (GEM) for them to take part in fun activities with their parents. You may sign up using the [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeu1nOfAzYj93ZojU24rfrk1F1uXGzGKh3eLWi7FGTaVksVfw/viewform) provided in the **poster as attached** and include any questions that you would like to find out about our school in preparation for your child's transition to Primary 1. You can also take this opportunity to bring your child to have first-hand experience in finding out more about the school facilities.

Do also take part in Uncle Ringo’s carnival such as rides, inflatables and games booths, and other exciting activities such as Dazhong Eco Fair, Photo-taking with Star Wars troopers, Eco Trail and more.

Funds raised from the event will be channeled to support school-based financial assistance schemes for the needy students. I am sure your child will have so much fun while bonding with you and friends for a good cause!

_Book your tickets here! [go.gov.sg/dzcarnival](http://go.gov.sg/dzcarnival) !_ Payment can be done at our school’s General Office between 2pm to 5pm during school days, and 9am to 4pm during the June school holidays.

Hope to see you there!
