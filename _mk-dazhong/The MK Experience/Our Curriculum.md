<br><strong>Starlight Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Starlight Literacy Programme aims to nurture early childhood bilingualism.
It is offered in English and the three Mother Tongue Languages, providing
opportunities for children to enjoy English and their Mother Tongue Language,
communicate with confidence and be aware of local traditions and customs.
Language learning is made fun for children through the use of a rich variety
of resources such as Big Books, songs and games set in the local context.

<br>
<br><strong>(NEW!)</strong>  <strong>Pilot Programme to Increase MTL Exposure in MOE Kindergartens (PRIME)</strong>
</p>
<p>MK@Dazhong has embarked on a Pilot programme, PRIME, that aims to build
a firm Mother Tongue Language (MTL) foundation for young learners and nurture
their motivation to learn MTL by increasing children’s exposure to MTL.
Children will experience an additional 30 minutes of learning activities
conducted in MTL under the pilot programme.</p>
<p>Through this programme, children experience joy in learning and confidence
in using MTL and gain more opportunities to learn and use MTL within and
beyond schools. It will continue to focus on the development of children’s
listening, speaking and early literacy skills through age-appropriate resources
and activities.</p>
<p><strong>Weeks of Wonder (WoW) projects!</strong>
</p>
<p>To deepen children’s learning, each term culminates in a WoW project.
Children work together with their friends and teachers to investigate topics
of their interest. Through the WoW projects, children experience the joy
of self-motivated learning and find answers to their questions.</p>
<p>These experiences seek to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Encourage collaboration as children work together to investigate a topic
of their interest;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop process skills as children gather information from different sources
and communicate their findings; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote communication skills as children carry out WoW projects in English
and their Mother Tongue Languages.</p>

<br><strong>Learning Journeys and collaborations</strong>
</p>
<p>Our learning journeys provide children with authentic experiences that
help them understand the world around them. Thoughtfully planned by our
teachers, each experience is purposeful and aligned with clear teaching
and learning objectives.</p>
<p>In addition to field trips, external partners are also invited to our
MK to enrich children’s learning through show-and-tell sessions, puppet
shows and other interactive experiences that extend classroom learning.
