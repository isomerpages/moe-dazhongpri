### DZ Kindergarten Care

To provide support to parents who may need care services for their children beyond the MOE Kindergarten hours, Kindergarten Care (KCare) will be offered at our centre from 2 Jan 2019. The optional add-on care service will be offered before and after the 4-hour MOE Kindergarten programme. The services will be run by an MOE-appointed operator.
