<p>
<br>At Dazhong, we are committed to unlocking every student's potential by
providing them with the tools and strategies needed for both academic achievement
and positive character development.</p>
<p><strong><u>Tier 1: Universal Support</u></strong>
<br>Our teachers establish clear behavioural expectations and school-wide
positive reinforcement for all students. We believe in creating a structured
environment where students thrive through proactively teaching appropriate
conduct and consistently recognising good behaviour through our High-Potential
Learner assembly sharings.
<br>
<br>The school’s approach to academic excellence centres on three fundamental
steps: Prepare, Participate, and Practise. Through this structured framework,
we empower our students to become confident, independent learners who can
achieve their highest potential.</p>

<p><strong><u>Tier 2: Targeted Support</u></strong>
<br>Year Heads provide dedicated leadership and pastoral care for each cohort,
working closely with form teachers to monitor student progress and wellbeing.
They serve as the key liaison between students, parents, and school leadership,
ensuring targeted support that meets each year group's developmental needs
through our Behavioural Support Plans. Through their guidance, Year Heads
foster a strong sense of community and maintain high standards across their
cohorts.</p>
