### Scouts

**CCA Overview**

DZPS Cub Scouts is a member of the Singapore Scout Association which is a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement.
Our purpose is to help young people to develop their full physical, intellectual, emotional, social, and spiritual capacities as individuals and as members of society, and thus contribute to the development of a better world. 

Through Scoutingâ€™s unique method of progressive self-education, we aim to provide members with a rich and active learning environment.

Follow us on Facebook and Instagram to get the latest updates on our CCA activities and achievements!
