<h3>Junior Orchestra</h3>
<p><strong>CCA Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>Dazhong Primary School is currently the only primary school in Singapore
offering a full Junior Orchestra (JO). At present, the members of the Orchestra
stand at 100 members strong. One of the key aims of this programme is to
uplift students through music and by providing opportunities that they
may not have access to.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives of Dazhong Junior Orchestra:</strong>
</p>
<p>Besides equipping our JO students with musical knowledge and 21cc skills,
JO programme is set up to:
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>uplift and transform young lives through music (social change).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide our students opportunities and multiple pathways based on their
strengths, interests and talents.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Junior Orchestra is an extension of the Learning for Life Programme (LLP)
and is part of the Arts Education Programme@Dazhong (AEP@Dazhong). As part
of AEP@Dazhong, all Primary 1 to 3 students go through the String Ensemble
(violin) music programme. Students who show an aptitude and interest in
the performing arts are invited to further develop their skills and deepen
their passion through JO. The JO programme has brought about positive outcomes
for our students. They are more attuned to their social and emotional competencies
and their self-efficacy has seen positive growth. Our Junior Orchestra
students had performed in many outreach community platforms like at Hong
Kah North Community Club National Day events, National Gallery, SYF Arts
Presentation as well as President Charity Show. Our students are featured
in the Straits Times, Lian He Zao Bao as well as Suria TV.</p>
<p><strong>Junior Orchestra as Uplift Force – Inclusive Music approach</strong>
</p>
<p>Taking an inclusive approach, the Junior Orchestra provides students with
access to learning an individual instrument and strengthen music education.
In order to create an inclusive music environment with meaningful learning
experiences for all students, teachers leverage the school’s value of Acceptance
to instill the importance of this value by teaching students how to accept
all students regardless of their backgrounds or abilities.</p>
<p>With the development of Music curriculum at Dazhong Primary School, our
students are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to explore
further their interests in the various fields of instrumental playing and
in their secondary school of choice or through Direct School Admission
(DSA). Some of our students have also been identified for the SOTA Temasek
Foundation Award for Arts Development. Our students have been given opportunities
to participate in school and community events, collaborate with other schools,
and perform at community and/or national level.</p>
<p>Dazhong Junior Orchestra has collaborated with Methodist Girls’ School
(MGS) since 2018. The MGS students have inspired our Dazhong students with
their talents, knowlwedge and skills in music making. Our students have
benefited from this collaboration with MGS as it has helped them to become
more confident, focused and disciplined. In 2023, Dazhong Junior Orchestra
collaborates with NUS Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music (NUS YST) through
sessions in which YST students are guided towards coaching our Dazhong
students through their undergraduate module, Orchestral Pedagogy. This
culminates in a Children’s Concert in which our JO students perform side
by side with YST students in a family-oriented concert at the Conservatory
Orchestra Hall at NUS YST.</p>
<p>The school also firmly believes that music can bring about social change
and has helped transform the lives of many of our students. Many JO students
have joined the JO alumni and exemplified the vision of serving leaders
by giving back to their juniors by coaching and mentoring them. Junior
Orchestra Programme helps to inspire students to share their love of music
and bring joy to the community and all.</p>
