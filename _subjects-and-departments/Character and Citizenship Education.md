<h3>Character &amp; Citizenship Education</h3>
<h4>Philosophy</h4>
<p>The school believes that it is not only important to develop in pupils
a strong moral fibre grounded on sound values but they must also be equipped
with the competencies to enable them to live out their beliefs. As the
hardware must be complemented by the heartware, to develop in pupils sound
character and a strong sense of citizenry, pupils must not only be taught
the right values, attitudes and competencies but the school must also provide
a conducive environment for these to be caught.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driven by this belief, the school adopts a tiered approach that seeks
to enable pupils to Know the right values and attitudes, provide the platforms
to engage in hands-on activities (Do) and practice those values and attitudes
and develop the desired competencies for the pupils to Become the individuals
who have internalized those desired values and attitudes. Platforms are
provided also for these pupils to live out their beliefs and influence
their peers to be the individuals with the desired values, attitudes and
competencies.</p>

<p><strong>National Education – “NE Current Buzz”</strong>
</p>
<p>Pupils learn to generate ideas, share opinions and learn from one another
as they discuss current affairs during their English Language periods.</p>
<p><strong>National Education – Total Defence Day</strong>
</p>
<p>Through the various activities, pupils learnt more about the five pillars
of Total Defence. During recess, pupils learnt about the resilience and
perseverance experienced by our pioneers during the World War II. Like
previous years, we managed to partner the Neighbourhood Police and the
pupils learnt more about civil defence and not take our home security for
granted.</p>
<p>In conjunction with Total Defence Week and emphasising Digital Defence,
the school takes part in the annual global initiative aiming to promote
safer and more responsible technology use among students. While we acknowledge
the benefits of technology for learning and socialising, it's important
for students to understand that excessive use can also harm their well-being.
To foster balance, we recommend a 'Screen-free Weekend'. We hope that the
time can be used for family bonding. Visit <a href="https://www.digitalforlife.gov.sg/Learn/Resources" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.digitalforlife.gov.sg/Learn/Resources</a> for
more tips on fostering healthy digital habits!</p>

<p><strong>International Friendship Day</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore works with our ASEAN neighbours for peace and collaboration
in the region. As we are part of this community, we need to develop our
cross-cultural skills and relate to one another respectfully and effectively.
We need to remain open to the international flow of trade, ideas and talent
which is critical to ASEAN’s growth as a region, and Singapore’s continued
success as a nation.</p>
<p>Together with the Parents Support Group (PSG), a series of exciting activities
had been lined up for students to deepen their understanding of the relations
that we share with other countries.</p>
