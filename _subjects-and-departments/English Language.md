<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/EL01.jpg">
</div>
<h4>Vision:</h4>
<p>An effective, affective and self-directed English Language learner and
user</p>
<h4>Mission:</h4>
<p>To nurture students to be self-directed and empathetic communicators,
discerning readers and creative inquirers (EL Syllabus 2020)</p>
<h4>Key Approaches:</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Excite</strong> – inculcate the values of language learning and
excite students to want to use English Language as a form of communication
through authentic experiences and play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engage</strong> – involve students in their learning so that they
will be active learners and provide reflection checkpoints to develop metacognitive
skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Empower</strong> – design lessons and programmes such as students
have a choice in their own learning. Provide students the autonomy to direct
their own learning to develop them into agents of change to lead others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*Differentiated instructions will be infused through the 3 key approaches
above.</p>
<h4>Milestone Programmes</h4>
<p><strong>1. Self-directed learning through ICT-enabled lessons (Excite and Engage)</strong>
</p>

</div>
<p>Blended learning and technology-enabled lessons allow our students to
learn deeply at their own pace, collaborate with peers and still have the
autonomy to pursue their areas of interest. Teachers leverage ICT to cater
to students with differing readiness, interests and learning styles.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;Dare to Read&nbsp;(Excite, Engage, and Empower)</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Read today, lead tomorrow. Believing that reading is fundamental to language
acquisition, the department builds a culture of reading through Dare to
Read, a whole-school approach to reading. (Engage and Empower)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relevant, authentic and personal learning experiences through the discussion
of contemporary, environmental and sustainability issues so as to take
action and effect change (Excite and Empower)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The school’s Media Resource Library, D’ Safari, reaches out to students
through a wide variety of programmes and activities. Parents, grandparents
and siblings can also join in the fun with students in some of our programmes
which are specially designed to promote bonding and fun.</p>
<p><strong>Avid Reader Card</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:80%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/el6.png">
</div>
<p>Taking inspiration from the popular Young Scientist Card, the Avid Reader
Card was introduced to stimulate an interest in reading and nurture a love
of reading. Comprising a series of self-directed&nbsp;tasks&nbsp;designed
for Lower and Upper Primary students, each completed task earns students
stars, which may be&nbsp;redeemed for&nbsp;a&nbsp;reading reward at D’Safari.
A compilation of the best work is showcased termly.</p>

<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:80%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/el9.png">
</div>
<p>Tapping on the affordances of the Student Learning Space (SLS) and other
ICT tools, the Library Team curates digital stories recorded by teachers
and students and assigns “lessons” to students through the English Language
teachers. In these lessons, students view book recommendations by Dazhong
teachers, listen to stories read by teachers and schoolmates and complete
quizzes and activities based on the featured stories.</p>
<p><strong>Devices in the Library for Reading and Learning</strong>

<p>Our school library is a vibrant hub of activity during recess, with students
eagerly delving into the world of audiobooks. To support auditory learning
and enhance our students' reading experiences, our library offers devices

<p><strong>Thematic Book Display</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:80%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/el10.png">

<p>Every month, the book display is refreshed to feature the school’s wide
collection of books. Besides having selected books on display, there are
also theme-based activity sheets. Students turn in completed sheets for
a small reading token.</p>
<p><strong>Author of the Month Display</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:80%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/el11.png">
</div>
<p>The library showcases&nbsp;a different author every month. Students read
biographies about writers and learn what sparked an interest in writing.
Hopefully, they get inspired to write a short story or two!</p>

<p>To commemorate World Book Day, well-loved book characters from around
the world gather at Dazhong Primary School every year to inspire the love
of reading in Stories Come Alive! As concerned citizens, our students and
staff endeavour to put on their Green Maker hats and create their costumes
using recycled materials. Students also come together to share about their
favourite books and encourage their peers to read!</p>

<p>Through the P1 and P2 Speech and Drama PAL Module, students are inspired
to develop a love for the English Language as they learn to express their
thoughts and ideas confidently and effectively. The programme is taught
by our very own English Language teachers who strive to bring well-loved
STELLAR big book titles to life and introduce students to basic drama skills.
Students, through drama, learn to communicate ideas through discussion
and group work and foster commitment and co-operation amongst their peers</p>

<h4>Stretch Programmes</h4>

</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/EL05.jpg">
</div>
<p>To develop empathetic communicators, every fortnight, the school tunes
into STAND during morning assembly. Students are challenged to think critically
about what they see or hear in the news and report the latest and most
inspiring news happening in Singapore and around the world. Students acquire
general knowledge and vocabulary, honing their listening and comprehension
skills whilst being inspired to create a better Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>2. Reading Circles</strong>
</p>
<p>The Reading Circles programme for selected students in Primary 4 and 5
focuses on cognitive, affective, and social outcomes. Participants will
develop an understanding of active reading and inquiry, recognizing that
reading involves constructing meaning, making connections, and engaging
in reflective responses. They will learn to consider elements in texts
and the writer’s purpose, and to develop awareness of language use and
context. Skills acquired include questioning texts, making connections
to personal experiences and real-world issues, inferring meaning, and engaging
in discussions. Affective outcomes include enjoying responses to texts,
developing empathy, and applying understandings to their own lives. Socially,
students will set learning goals, manage their learning, collaborate with
others, and appreciate diverse perspectives. The programme fosters curiosity,
perseverance, and confident communication.</p>
<h4>Support Programmes</h4>
<p><strong>1. Learning Support Programme (LSP)</strong>
</p>
<p>The LSP for English provides specialised early intervention for students
who need additional help with English language skills. Identified at Primary
1 through screening conducted upon school entry, these students receive
focused support from trained teachers. The programme involves half-hour
daily sessions conducted in small groups of 8 to 10 students, ensuring
personalised attention and effective learning outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>2. Reading Remediation Programme (RRP)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our school provides the RRP to support Primary 3 and 4 students with literacy
difficulties who are not diagnosed with dyslexia. RRP aims to help these
students read with fluency and understanding, and includes those who were
not previously in the Learning Support Programme (LSP) but are assessed
to benefit from additional support at the end of Primary 2.</p>
<p><strong>3. School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR) Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>We offer the SDR Programme, a specialised and intensive after-school literacy
intervention for Primary 3 and 4 students with dyslexia. This two-year
programme, taught by specially trained teachers, focuses on phonics, word
reading and spelling, text reading fluency, vocabulary, and reading comprehension
to address individual literacy needs.</p>
