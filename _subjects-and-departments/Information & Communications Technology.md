<h3>Information &amp; Communications Technology (ICT)</h3>
<p>In line with the<strong> EdTech Masterplan 2030</strong> and the <strong>21st Century Competencies </strong>framework,
the school aims to cultivate <strong>self-directed</strong> and <strong>collaborative learners </strong>who
are actively engaged in their learning and proficient collaborators. This
is achieved by integrating EdTech into the core curriculum and instructional
programmes, harnessing ICT to integrate content knowledge with, in particular
â€“ the development of<strong>&nbsp;Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills</strong>.</p>

<p>Central to this approach is the use of <strong>SLS as a one-stop hub</strong>,
and the strategic development of student <strong>self-directedness</strong> and <strong>collaboration skills</strong> using
EdTech from Primary 1 to Primary 6, in gradation to their cognitive growth.</p>
<p>Our teachers enables the abovementioned by embracing <strong>e-Pedagogy</strong>,
which involves the use of technology to facilitate active learning, fostering
a participatory, connected, and reflective classroom environment to cultivate
future-ready learners.</p>

<p>We aim to <strong>harness the power of Artificial Intelligence</strong> on
SLS and other online platforms to enable a <strong>personalised learning experience</strong>.
AI will provide customised feedback based on student responses. Our aim
is to develop students to be <strong>self-directed and use the AI feedback to enhance and monitor their learning</strong>,
as we believe they are high-potential learners who can all succeed. Therefore,
we use AI to promote equity in success.</p>

<p>At Dazhong, we prioritise active learning and interactions by integrating
technology into our instructional design. Using suitable e-Pedagogy, we
develop 21st Century Competencies, Digital Literacy, and Technological
Skills. Guided by the EdTech Pedagogical Scaffold and Key Applications
of Technology, we enhance educational experiences. Our aim is to seamlessly
blend technology into both physical and digital learning spaces, creating
diverse and engaging learning contexts for our students.</p>
<h3>Digital Literacy and Technological Skills (DLTS)</h3>
<p>In Dazhong, we ensure that students are well-equipped with the digital
competencies to thrive in an increasingly technology-saturated future.</p>

<p>The <strong>Tech Explorer Programme</strong>, formerly known as the Touch-Typing
Programme, is designed specifically for our Primary 1 and 2 students. This
tailored programme aims to equip our young learners with essential online
skills crucial for their academic journey.</p>
<p>Through a series of engaging activities, the Tech Explorers programme
will cover:</p>
<p>1. Fundamental concepts including <strong>digital citizenship </strong>and <strong>online safety</strong>.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Safe handling</strong> of school hardware.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Basic login skills </strong>to school Chromebook and SLS with
MIMS credentials.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Touch-typing</strong> proficiency</p>
<h4><strong>Primary 3 DLTS</strong></h4>
<p>The P3 DLTS plan develops students' digital skills in several areas: Digital
Responsibility (internet etiquette, diversity), Device and Software Operations
(video conferencing, presentation software), Digital Communication and
Collaboration (visual literacy, digital creation tools, collaborative tools),
and Participation (online bulletin boards).</p>
<h4><strong>Primary 4 DLTS</strong></h4>
<p>The P4 DLTS plan covers: Digital Information Management (search skills,
data organisation, privacy), Digital Responsibility (communication tools,
online identity, community participation), Digital Communication and Collaboration
(creating digital artefacts), Data Competencies (data analysis and presentation),
and Device and Software Operations (spreadsheets, word processing).</p>
<h4><strong>Primary 5 DLTS</strong></h4>
<p>The P5 DLTS plan includes Digital Responsibility, where students learn
to communicate and share information responsibly and ethically. Our vendor-run
ALP programme also teach students the basics of block coding, sensor applications,
and creating models to conserve resources. Under Digital Communication,
Collaboration, and Participation, students also learn how to plan and evaluate
digital artefacts, select appropriate mediums and tools, edit video files,
and share files online to create and share digital content efficiently.</p>
<h4><strong>Primary 6 DLTS</strong></h4>
<p>The P6 DLTS plan includes Coding &amp; Programming with vendor-run AI
lessons by IMDA. In Digital Responsibility, students learn about copyright,
Creative Commons, and plagiarism, applying ethical and legal understanding
in digital creation through self-directed pre-learning in IPW. They also
learn to choose appropriate social media platforms for sharing information
effectively.</p>
<h4>Stretch Programmes</h4><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/gbYb9iud8XLfsi7R/"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/ICT.png"></a>
<p>Upper primary students who demonstrate a keen interest and ability in
harnessing technology. These tech-adept students are provided with opportunities
to attend competitions such as the <strong>National Thinking Challenge,</strong> organised
in Singapore to foster <strong>critical thinking</strong> and<strong> problem-solving skills using technology</strong>.
Additionally, our students participate in the <strong>Swift Explorers programme</strong>,
headed by the <strong>School of Science and Technology (SST)</strong>, which
introduces young learners to the world of coding and <strong>app development using Swift,</strong> a
powerful and intuitive programming language. As part of this programme,
students engage in hands-on projects and challenges that enhance their
coding skills and creativity. Furthermore, we organise visits to Apple,
where students gain deeper insights into coding and innovative tech applications.
Through these experiences, we aim to nurture their technological skills
and inspire them to become future tech leaders.</p>
<h4>Cyber Wellness</h4>
<p><strong>Good Digital Habits</strong>
</p>
<p>In today's digital age, online content is ubiquitous, and there is an
increased risk and exposure to harmful material. It is more important than
ever that our students have a strong foundation in cyber wellness. At Dazhong,
we work diligently within our school to encourage children to take good
care of devices and use them responsibly. We also involve parents in the
children's development of good digital habits through our Cyber Wellness
newsletter, which contains valuable insights and tips for promoting a positive
online experience for our children.</p>
<p><strong>Safer Internet Day</strong>
</p>
<p>In conjunction with Total Defence Week and emphasising Digital Defence,
the school takes part in the annual global initiative aiming to promote
safer and more responsible technology use among students. While we acknowledge
the benefits of technology for learning and socialising, it's important
for students to understand that excessive use can also harm their well-being.
To foster balance, we recommended a 'Screen-free Weekend', encouraging
students to use the time for family bonding.
