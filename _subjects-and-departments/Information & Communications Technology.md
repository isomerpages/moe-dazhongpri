<h3>Information &amp; Communications Technology (ICT)</h3>
<p>Aligned with the EdTech Masterplan 2030 and the 21st Century Competencies
(21CC) framework, our school aims to nurture self-directed and collaborative
learners by fostering active learning and interaction. Through purposeful
integration of EdTech and appropriate e-Pedagogy, we develop studentsâ€™
21CC, including digital literacy and technological skills, while blending
technology meaningfully across both physical and digital learning spaces.</p>

<p>Central to this approach is the use of <strong>SLS as a one-stop hub</strong>,
and the strategic development of student <strong>self-directedness</strong> and <strong>collaboration skills</strong> using
EdTech from Primary 1 to Primary 6, in gradation to their cognitive growth.</p>
<p>Our EdTech journey is guided by the <strong>RAT model</strong>, <strong>EdTech Pedagogical Scaffold</strong>,
and <strong>Key Applications of Technology (KAT)</strong> to ensure meaningful
tech integration. We also harness <strong>AI on platforms like SLS</strong> to
provide personalised feedback, helping students become self-directed learners
and promoting equity in success.</p>
<h3>Digital Literacy and Technological Skills (DLTS)</h3>
<p>In Dazhong, we ensure that students are well-equipped with the digital
competencies to thrive in an increasingly technology-saturated future.</p>

<h4><strong>Lower Block DLTS (Primary 1 &amp; 2)</strong></h4>
<p>The Lower Block DLTS focuses on Cyber Security and balanced screen time,
guiding young learners in responsible device use, secure login skills including
MIMS and Chromebook access, and digital citizenship fundamentals. Students
also develop touch-typing proficiency to support their learning in a safe
and balanced digital environment.</p>
<h4><strong>Middle Block DLTS (Primary 3 &amp; 4)</strong></h4>
<p>The Middle Block DLTS emphasises Digital Communication, Collaboration,
and Information Skills. Students engage in collaborative tasks using Google
Suite tools, learning to co-create digital artefacts and communicate effectively
in shared digital spaces. They also develop essential research skills,
including responsible information search, data organisation, and basic
data analysis. Alongside these, students explore digital responsibility
by understanding internet etiquette, online identity, and respectful participation
in online communities.</p>
<h4><strong>Upper Block DLTS (Primary 5 &amp; 6)</strong></h4>
<p>The Upper Block DLTS focuses on Cyber Wellness and Kindness, guiding students
to be responsible digital citizens. They learn to communicate ethically,
respect copyright and intellectual property, and practise good social media
etiquette. Through hands-on experiences with block coding, AI, and digital
tools, students also develop skills in collaboration, content creation,
and sustainable problem-solving using technology.</p>
<h4>Stretch Programmes</h4><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/gbYb9iud8XLfsi7R/"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/ICT.png"></a>
<p>Upper primary students who demonstrate a keen interest and ability in
harnessing technology. These tech-adept students are provided with opportunities
to attend competitions such as the <strong>National Thinking Challenge,</strong> organised
in Singapore to foster <strong>critical thinking</strong> and<strong> problem-solving skills using technology</strong>.
Additionally, our students participate in the <strong>Swift Explorers programme</strong>,
headed by the <strong>School of Science and Technology (SST)</strong>, which
introduces young learners to the world of coding and <strong>app development using Swift,</strong> a
powerful and intuitive programming language. As part of this programme,
students engage in hands-on projects and challenges that enhance their
coding skills and creativity. Furthermore, we organise visits to Apple,
where students gain deeper insights into coding and innovative tech applications.
Through these experiences, we aim to nurture their technological skills
and inspire them to become future tech leaders.</p>
<h4>Cyber Wellness</h4>
<p><strong>Good Digital Habits</strong>
</p>
<p>In today's digital age, online content is ubiquitous, and there is an
increased risk and exposure to harmful material. It is more important than
ever that our students have a strong foundation in cyber wellness. At Dazhong,
we work diligently within our school to encourage children to take good
care of devices and use them responsibly.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting Your Childâ€™s Digital Wellness</strong>
</p>
<p>We encourage parents to explore the Parenting for Wellness Toolbox (by
MOE, MSF &amp; HPB).</p>

<p><strong>Safer Internet Day</strong>
</p>
<p>In conjunction with Total Defence Week and emphasising Digital Defence,
the school takes part in the annual global initiative aiming to promote
safer and more responsible technology use among students. While we acknowledge
the benefits of technology for learning and socialising, it's important
for students to understand that excessive use can also harm their well-being.
To foster balance, we recommended a 'Screen-free Weekend', encouraging
students to use the time for family bonding.
