<p><strong>P1 Orientation @ DAZHONG!</strong>
</p>
<p>The first step into a new adventure!âœ¨</p>
<p>Here we go again, welcoming our excited yet anxious Primary 1 students
and parents to our school on P1 Orientation Day! This is an important part
of the P1 START RIGHT! Transition Programme that provides an opportunity
for incoming P1 students to be familiarized with their teachers and learning
environment. It was heartwarming to see their excitement grow as they met
their teachers and friends, and toured the school.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Such a big milestone for the P1 students!</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are also truly honored and thankful to have our distinguished guest,
Minister Chan Chun Sing, joining us for this year's P1 Orientation. His
presence makes the event even more memorable as we welcome our young learners
to this new chapter of their educational journey!ðŸŽ‰</p>
<p></p>
<p>We hope the P1 students and parents had a memorable P1 Orientation Day.
Here's to a new year full of learning, friendship and endless possibilities.
See you on the first day of the school year in 2025!ðŸŒŸ</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Every Dazhong Student is a High Potential Student! </strong>ðŸ’¯</p>
<p>On behalf of the P1 Orientation Team (Shereen, Meena, Nuraini, Gwendolene
and Jonathan), a big thank you to all our dedicated teachers and staff,
and supportive parents for making this orientation a success and meaningful
one. Your support and enthusiasm made a world of difference for our P1
students.. <em>Kampung spirit</em> indeed!
