### Student Well-Being

#### Peer Support & Relationships (PSR) + Cyber Wellness (CW)

#### Vision:

Every Dazhong student is a Peer Supporter and advocate for Cyber Wellness.

  

#### Mission:

To create a **Caring** and **Enabling** School environment by:

*   Empowering students to be **positive influencers and leaders**
*   Bridging **the adult and student divide** to strengthen our student’ safety nets
*   Creating a **protective factor** for students at risk through the building of positive relationships
*   Contributing to a positive school **Culture of Care**.

  

#### Key Approaches for Student Well-Being @ DZPS:

In order to create a **Caring and Enabling** School environment and strengthen our school’s **Culture of Care**, the school looks into the various aspects of **Student Well-Being** through these areas:

*   Positive Teacher-Student Relationships
*   Positive Peer Support & Relationships   
*   Mental Health
*   Cyber Wellness
*   Students with Needs

It is a whole-school effort to equip all students with the necessary skills to support their own well-being as well as strengthen their school support systems (both offline & online). This is further supported by our teachers. A two-prong approach is thus adopted by our school to address this:

**1\. Level 1 PSR and CW (All Students)**<br>**_DZPS 3E  - Excite & Engage_**

*   Cyber Wellness Weeks (as part of NE events - Total Defence Day, IFD, Racial Harmony, National Day)
*   PSR infused as part of School Programmes (e.g. School Camps, Stories Come Alive!)
*   FTGP Lessons & Assembly Talks for the explicit teaching of PSR and CW

    **2. Level 2 PSR and CW (Peer Support Leaders & ICT Champions)**<br>**_DZPS 3E  - Engage_ & _Empower_**

*   Training of Peer Support Leaders (PSL) and ICT Champions
*   Platforms for PSLs and ICT Champion to be Serving Leaders:

  

*   Provide peer support and help to their peers in their own class / level
*   Serve as Cyber Wellness ambassadors during NE events to drive CW messages
*   Promote a Culture of Care in school by welcoming their peers at the start of each term, and doing a proper farewell to their peers at the end of each term.
*   Promote Inclusivity in our school by peer supporting selected ISPR Students (Building Bridges Programme)
