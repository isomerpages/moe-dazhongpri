### Outdoor Education Programme

<img src="/images/cce34.png" style="width:60%">

We believe that the outdoors is a dynamic environment which stimulates learning in the head (knowledge), heart (attitude) and hands (skills) in an authentic way. It is also a good platform for character, social and leadership development and values inculcation through outdoor activities.

  

As part of the school’s efforts to provide our pupils with opportunities to Explore, Experience and Excel (3Es), we have implemented a 6-year Outdoor Education Programme which seeks to inculcate in pupils a love for the outdoors, develop resilience and graciousness and bring out the adventurous spirit in them as they carry out activities in an environment which is out of their comfort zone. These activities also seek to develop our pupils to be achievers rooted in values, soaring beyond limits (school vision).

  

**Physical Education (PE): Outdoor Education**

The basis for the Outdoor Education Programme is based on the Learning Outcomes for Outdoor Education as stated in the PE Syllabus. The pupils’ learning experience are set in an authentic context of a day trip to a neighbouring park by Primary 4 and a residential camp by Primary 6.

  

**PAL (Programme for Active Learning)**

Primary 1 and 2 will also enhanced their outdoor experience through PAL (Programme for Active Learning) programme. Pupils will learn and apply socio-emotional competencies through outdoor skills like basic map reading, first aid and how to prepare for an outdoor trip.


**Residential Outdoor Camp**

The focus for Primary 4 and 6 pupils is to extend their outdoor experience in an authentic setting by participating in a 2 Days &amp; 1 Night and 3 Days &amp; 2 Nights camps respectively. Pupils will get to overcome their fears and challenges as they scale the various high ropes courses, and participate in dragon-boating and kayaking, team-building and hiking activities.

Through the Outdoor Education Programme, we hope that our pupils will develop a greater awareness of themselves and others, better manage themselves and friendship with others and learn to make responsible decisions. School values like integrity, responsibility, excellence, acceptance and perseverance are also reinforced though the programme.
