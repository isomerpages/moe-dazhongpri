### Character & Citizenship Education
  
#### Philosophy

The school believes that it is not only important to develop in pupils a strong moral fibre grounded on sound values but they must also be equipped with the competencies to enable them to live out their beliefs. As the hardware must be complemented by the heartware, to develop in pupils sound character and a strong sense of citizenry, pupils must not only be taught the right values, attitudes and competencies but the school must also provide a conducive environment for these to be caught. 

  

Driven by this belief, the school adopts a tiered approach that seeks to enable pupils to Know the right values and attitudes, provide the platforms to engage in hands-on activities (Do) and practice those values and attitudes and develop the desired competencies for the pupils to Become the individuals who have internalized those desired values and attitudes. Platforms are provided also for these pupils to live out their beliefs and influence their peers to be the individuals with the desired values, attitudes and competencies.

The school seeks to provide a rigorous CCE programme through developing the pupils in the four key domains: Citizenry, Leadership, Personal Mastery and Resilience. These domains provide a fundamental and holistic foundation to the personal growth and development of pupils. The CCE programme is also undergirded by Howard Gardner’s Five Minds for the Future to drive the process of developing the pupils to achieve the desired outcomes, especially the Respectful and Ethical Minds.

Prior to visiting the day-care patients, and in collaboration with HCA Hospice, pupils also learnt how to engage and interact with elderly through a workshop.
