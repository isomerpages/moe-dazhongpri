### Parent Support Group&nbsp;

![](/images/IMG_0140.jpg)

In Dazhong Primary School, we strive to develop all our students holistically so that they grow to become <b>Self-Directed Learners, Serving Leaders and Concerned Citizens.</b> Parents are important partners to the school in providing a positive, enriching and holistic education experience for our students. The <b>Parent Support Group (PSG)</b> is a bridge that has strengthened school-home partnership in Dazhong.<br>

We are thankful to have dedicated PSG members, led by the PSG Executive Committee (EXCO), who collaborate with the school and contribute to the development of our students through their active participation and co-planning of a range of school activities and curricular programmes. <br>

Our PSG also plays an important role to strengthen the circle of support for Dazhong parents. As resource supporters, the PSG shares useful tips and resources on parenting and student mental well-being with its members regularly.  Furthermore, they are peer supporters for one another in their parenting journey.  
Our PSG also complements our school’s effort to promote environmental stewardship and sustainability through the development of the 3As (Awareness, Action and Advocacy) in our students. 

Our PSG has supported our school in many ways such as;<br>

*	**Academic / Non-Academic Curricular Programmes:** EL Extensive Reading, Math Exploration Week, AEP Recital, Sports Day, JO Morning Buzz, CCA Support or Performances, P4 Swimsafer<br>
*	**Green Makers @ Dazhong (Applied Learning Programme):** Rooftop Greenery, Earth Day, P6 Career Fair, Green Initiatives<br>
*	**Student Well-Being—Resource &amp; Peer Supporters:** Supporting other parents in their parenting journey; outreach to parents<br>
*	**Events:** School Anniversary, EL Fiesta cum International Friendship Day, Mother Tongue Fortnight, Racial Harmony Day, Total Defence Day, National Day, Teacher’s Day, Children’s Day, Deepavali, Chinese New Year and Hari Raya.

PSG support is important to promoting positive relationships, understanding and effective communication between parents and the school. By being a member of the PSG, you will have opportunities to not only be involved in your child’s school life, but also help other students in Dazhong Primary School. You can also gain a better understanding about your child’s learning, emotional and psychological needs at home and in school.
