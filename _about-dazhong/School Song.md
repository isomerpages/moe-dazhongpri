### School Song

#### Verse 1:

Like an A.R.C.H.E.R we strive to seek<br>
As far as we can see<br>
With resilience and curiosity<br>
We are Ace leaders with great empathy

#### Chorus:

High Potential Learners we can be<br>
Aim for our own peaks<br>
Soaring beyond limits<br>
We are Archers from Dazhong family


#### Verse 2:

Be the Greenovators we believe<br>
To strive and to achieve<br>
Through respect and humility<br>
Leading others towards our goals


#### Chorus:

High Potential Learners we can be<br>  
Aim for our own peaks<br>
Soaring beyond limits<br>
We are Archers from Dazhong family
