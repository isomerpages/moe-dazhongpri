<h4>School History</h4>
<p>Tai Cheong School was started in 1938 by Chinese immigrants, and was named
after its founding principal, Mr Chew Tai Cheong. The school stopped operations
briefly during the Japanese Occupation and resumed after the Japanese had
surrendered.</p>
<p>With the help of a member of Parliament, Mr Cao Yu Ying, a plot of land
was identified on a small hilltop, and in 1973, Tai Cheong school reopened
with 12 classrooms. In 1977, Tai Cheong Public School moved to its new
building at Track 7 Chua Chu Kang Road and was officially declared open
by Mr Chai Chong Yii, the Senior Minister of State for Education. The school
played a pivotal role in promoting the spirit of togetherness [‘Gotong
Royong’] in the community. On 1 April 1983, the school converted its status
from a Chinese village school to an English-medium government school. In
1989, Chua Chu Kang Primary School merged with Dazhong Primary. A new CCKPS
was established in 1994 for children in the Chua Chu Kang area. The school
was temporarily relocated from 2009 to 2010 during the PRIME upgrading,
and returned to its Bukit Batok premises in December 2011. In 2014, Dazhong
Primary School became the first school in Singapore to have a Ministry
of Education kindergarten co-sited within its premises. The school also
had its official opening ceremony on 1 August 2014.</p>
<p>Arts Education Programme@Dazhong is Dazhong Primary’s Learning for Life
Programme since 2014. It aims to develop 21st-century competencies in students
and prepare them to be future-ready. The school’s Junior Orchestra Talent
Development programme is supported by the Ministry of Education’s Arts
Education Branch.</p>
