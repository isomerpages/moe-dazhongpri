<h4>School History</h4>
<p>Rooted in a rich heritage dating back to 1938, Dazhong Primary School
has evolved into a vibrant learning community that nurtures the next generation
of creative thinkers and leaders. Our school's unique journey, overcoming
historical challenges and embracing change, reflects our commitment to
resilience and innovation.</p>
<p>Founded in 1938 by Chinese immigrants, Tai Cheong School was named after
its first principal, Mr. Chew Tai Cheong. It temporarily closed during
the Japanese Occupation but reopened in 1973 with support from Member of
Parliament Mr. Cao Yu Ying. The school moved to a new building in 1977
and became a vital part of the community, promoting unity and togetherness.
In 1983, it transitioned from a Chinese village school to an English-medium
government school. It later merged with Chua Chu Kang Primary School and
was rebuilt in Bukit Batok after a temporary relocation due to upgrading
works.</p>
<p>Today, as the first school in Singapore to house a Ministry of Education
kindergarten, we offer a seamless educational experience from preschool
to primary levels. Our renowned Arts Education Programme@Dazhong sets us
apart, empowering students with essential 21st-century skills through a
dynamic, holistic approach. Join us in shaping the future, where creativity
meets academic excellence. Discover the Dazhong difference – where every
student is a high potential learner!</p>
