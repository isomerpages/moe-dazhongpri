##### Why Green Makers @ Dazhong?  

Climate change is a significant threat to Singapore. This makes sustainable development even more important for Singapore’s next 50 years, with the SG Green Plan 2030 guiding our next step forward. To empower our students for the future they will inherit, our school has the distinctive Green Makers @ Dazhong Applied Learning Programme (ALP) that equips them with STEM Skills & Knowledge, and develops their Values & Dispositions for the 21 Century.

In this ALP, the theme of Sustainability comes together with the approach of Maker-Centred learning, for a Dazhong student to become **Aware** of the challenges of Sustainability in Singapore, take **Action** to make green solutions to tackle these challenges, and **Advocate** for others to do likewise. “Making our future green – From home, in school, and for Singapore!”  The outcomes and learning opportunities are encapsulated in the following ALP planning model:

The Green Makers @ Dazhong use the 4Ds Design Thinking protocol as our key thinking routine: **Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver.** This outlines four core principles for problem-solvers to adopt so that they can work as effectively as possible as they deepen their critical and inventive thinking.  

**_Discover_** – Investigate the problem by gathering information and conducting research.<br>
**_Define_** – Understand the problem and come up with a plan <br>**_Develop_** – Derive a solution and come up with a prototype to solve the problem <br>****_Dare, Design, Deliver_** – Test out the prototype and improve it** further. Be creative and persevere to come up with the best solution!

**Journey of Green Makers @ Dazhong.<br> (i) Primary Four and Five Level-wide Programmes, <br>(ii) Talent Development and Green Makers Student Development Programme,<br>(iii) Annual School-wide Dare Challenge,<br>(iv) Learning Environment & Partnerships with Community, and <br>(v) Peaks of Excellence**

**i. Primary Four and Five Level-wide Programmes**

Green Makers @ Dazhong will experience level-wide programmes as P4 and P5 students. The inter-disciplinary ALP programme engage students in sustainability projects, using Coding in Lego SPIKE Prime to build green solutions: Zero Waste @ P4, and Smart Homes @ P5. These projects empower students to build their own prototypes that can contribute meaningfully to various green initiatives in the home, school and community; and culminated in students videoing themselves Advocating for others to do likewise.

   **ii. Talent Development and Green Tech CCA**

For students with greater interest and aptitude, our Talent Development (SOAR) programme provides further opportunities. In 2020, our students won 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place at the national IDE Maker 2020 competition, for “Smart Solutions for Sustainable Resource Management”, with prototypes such as:

*   Rainwater collector with sensor that detects when rainwater collected has reached optimum level, then causing a motor to close the rain-collection-door.

  

*   Waste-sorter that uses a light sensor to detect whether an object is made of recyclable material, then if it is, operates a rotating flap that allows the object to enter.

By joining the Green Tech CCA, students can also develop solutions for green issues to participate in Sembcorp’s Green Wave Environmental Care Competition. Some examples include designing an Internet of things (IOT)-enabled wearable-device powered by a micro:bit, that students can bear around school to map out the coolest classrooms for afternoon activities, and another project that collects used orange peels to repurpose as refillable air fresheners for toilets.

Our student Eco-Champs have also collaborated with NParks for their Science Communication for Community in Nature Ambassadors Programme, called “Nature through Drama 2021”. Students acted as ambassadors for nature by filming themselves acting in a drama (“Otter Chaos”) to conduct outreach to the general public, such that others can develop an appreciation for Singapore’s biodiversity, and contribute to the conservation of our natural heritage.  

**iii. Annual School-wide Dare Challenge**

Our school conducts an annual **_Dare Challenge_** where students create green solutions and video themselves TED-style to share with their classmates, winning attractive prizes for themselves in the process! Our students have made many innovative creations, such as a claw machine of recycled cardboard, a candle-powered boat, and a self-watering plant pot – check out the highlights in the video below.

**iv.   Learning Environment & Partnerships with Community**  

Our school has a vibrant green learning environment with two Eco Ponds, a Sky Garden, and a Butterfly Garden. To enhance our Dazhong Sky Garden as a place where students can appreciate biodiversity in Singapore, we partner with the PSG, NParks Ambassadors, and keen citizen-gardeners from the Bukit Batok community to work with our school’s Scouts to plant and weed, with the efforts culminating in monthly harvests of fruits and vegetables. The fathers are not left out with Dads for Life doing a Saturday clean-up around the neighbourhood. Our Eco-Champs have also collaborated with our MP Dr Amy Khor to produce a video with NEA, promoting the anti-dengue message to residents of Hong Kah North CC while explaining how the Wolbachia project contributes to the fight.

To learn about Food Sustainability, our school also has our own earthworms that process food waste from the canteen, enabling students to learn about Food Sustainability in Singapore. We also grow our own fruits and vegetables using a hi-tech indoor aeroponics system.
