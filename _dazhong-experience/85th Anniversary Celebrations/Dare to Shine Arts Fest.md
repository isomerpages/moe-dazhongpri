#### Dare To Shine ARTS FEST

The Dazhong **_Dare to Shine ARTS Fest_** is a platform where our students talented in the Arts showcase their perseverance in practice, and celebrate their passion and success in mastering the fine skills in the Arts. The concert will feature our students from Junior Orchestra, Dance, Choir, Wushu, and MOE Kindergarten students. There will be special performances by the Tang Quartet and invited students from Annubusansem School, our twinning-programme school from Bangkok. There will also be on-site **sale of students’ artworks**.

Our theme of “**Dare to Shine**” aims to build **E**xcitement of the variety of talents learnt through our Learning for Life Programme of Arts Education, **E**ngage every student to Dare to Shine in the Community as Serving Leaders to raise funds for a good cause, and to **E**_mpower_ students to use the Arts to encourage others towards a more sustainable future for our school and community as Concerned Citizens (in line with our Applied Learning Programme of Green Makers @ Dazhong).
