#### Dazhong Community Day and Eco Carnival

The Dazhong Community Day and Eco-Carnival on 1 July 2023 was a momentous occasion for
both the students and staff who came together to spend a meaningful day with parents and
members of the community to raise funds for a good cause. From raising awareness through
the various green initiatives the school is involved in to the exciting activities such as the Eco-
fair booths, fun rides, inflatables, game booths and photo-taking with Star Wars troopers, this
event provided a significant opportunity for our students to lead in their various roles, show care
and contribute towards our school’s fund-raising efforts.

sustainability efforts. In addition, our Peer Support Leaders hosted the seniors from Lions
Befrienders and together, they took part in the activities at the Carnival. With the support from
our community and external partners, the Carnival was a roaring success and it allowed our
students to shine their light and bring joy to their fellow school mates and the community at
large – such by doing litter picking around the neighborhood.
