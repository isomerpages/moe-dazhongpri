#### Tree Planting Day

On 19 January 2023, Dazhong kicked-off our 85th Anniversary Celebrations with the first of 85 Acts of Kindness: Tree Planting. Members of Dazhong's School Advisory Committee, Parents, Teachers and Students, planted three Willow trees, which symbolize flexibility, adaptability, and the resilience to overcome adversity with grace.

These Willow trees are a symbol of our commitment to growth and renewal. Together, let us work to create a better and greener future for our school and community! Dazhong, Dare to Shine!
