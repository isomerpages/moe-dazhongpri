<h3>Information &amp; Communications Technology (ICT)</h3>
<p>In line with the<strong> EdTech Masterplan 2030</strong> and the <strong>21st Century Competencies </strong>framework,
the school aims to cultivate <strong>self-directed</strong> and <strong>collaborative learners </strong>who
are actively engaged in their learning and proficient collaborators. This
is achieved by integrating EdTech into the core curriculum and instructional
programmes, harnessing ICT to integrate content knowledge with, in particular
â€“ the development of<strong>&nbsp;Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills</strong>.</p>

<p>Central to this approach is the use of <strong>SLS as a one-stop hub</strong>,
and the strategic development of student <strong>self-directedness</strong> and <strong>collaboration skills</strong> using
EdTech from Primary 1 to Primary 6, in gradation to their cognitive growth.</p>
<p>Our teachers enables the abovementioned by embracing <strong>e-Pedagogy</strong>,
which involves the use of technology to facilitate active learning, fostering
a participatory, connected, and reflective classroom environment to cultivate
future-ready learners.</p>
<p>We also began to <strong>harness the power of Artificial Intelligence</strong> on
SLS and other online platforms to enable a <strong>personalised learning experience</strong>.
AI will provide customised feedback based on student responses. Our aim
is to develop students to be <strong>self-directed and use the AI feedback to enhance and monitor their learning</strong>,
as we believe they are high-potential learners who can all succeed. Therefore,
we use AI to promote equity in success.</p>

<p>By integrating <strong>active learning with technology</strong>, we prioritise
learning activities and interactions in our instructional design. We leverage
suitable e-Pedagogy learning experience types to achieve desired outcomes,
including the development of 21st Century Competencies (21CC), Digital
Literacy, and Technological Skills. Additionally, our teaching and learning
practices are guided by principles of the <strong>EdTech Pedagogical Scaffold</strong> and <strong>Key Applications of Technology</strong>,
demonstrating how technology enhances the educational experience. In Dazhong,
we aim to <strong>seamlessly integrate technology into both physical and digital learning spaces</strong>,
creating diverse learning contexts for our students.</p>
<h3>Digital Literacies and Technological Skills (DLTS)</h3>
<p>In Dazhong, we ensure that students are well-equipped with the digital
competencies to thrive in an increasingly technology-saturated future.</p>
<h4><strong>Tech Explorer Programme (Primary 1 &amp; 2)</strong></h4>

<p>The <strong>Tech Explorer Programme</strong>, formerly known as the Touch-Typing
Programme, is designed specifically for our Primary 1 and 2 students. This
tailored programme aims to equip our young learners with essential online
skills crucial for their academic journey.</p>
<p>Through a series of engaging activities, the Tech Explorers programme
will cover:</p>
<p>1. Fundamental concepts including <strong>digital citizenship </strong>and <strong>online safety</strong>.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Safe handling</strong> of school hardware.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Basic login skills </strong>to school Chromebook and SLS with
MIMS credentials.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Touch-typing</strong> proficiency</p>
<h4><strong>Primary 3 DLTS</strong></h4>
<p>The P3 Digital Literacy plan encompasses a comprehensive approach to developing
students' digital skills across various domains. In Digital Responsibility,
students will learn internet etiquette and appreciate diversity and social
cohesion through CCE FTGP lessons. Device and Software Operations will
cover basic operation of applications, such as using video conferencing
tools in self-paced SLS lessons and learning to use presentation software
in Science classes to create reports and presentations. In Digital Communication,
Collaboration, and Participation, students will understand visual literacy
and use digital creation tools in Art to efficiently produce digital artefacts.
They will also learn to work collaboratively using online bulletin boards
to share information as part of the MTL Reading Programme.</p>

<p>In today's digital age, online content is ubiquitous, and there is an
increased risk and exposure to harmful material. It is more important than
ever that our students have a strong foundation in cyber wellness. At Dazhong,
we work diligently within our school to encourage children to take good
care of devices and use them responsibly. We also involve parents in the
children's development of good digital habits through our Cyber Wellness
newsletter, which contains valuable insights and tips for promoting a positive
online experience for our children.</p>
