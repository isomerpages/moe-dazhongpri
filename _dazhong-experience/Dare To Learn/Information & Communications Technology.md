<h3>Information &amp; Communications Technology (ICT)</h3>
<p>Aligned with the EdTech Masterplan 2030 and the 21st Century Competencies,
the school seeks to develop<strong> self-directed</strong> and<strong> collaborative learners</strong> who
are engaged and take ownership in their learning through integrating Edtech
into instructional programmes. ICT is harnessed to integrate content knowledge
with, in particular – the component of<strong>&nbsp;Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills</strong>&nbsp;–
to equip students with creating, curating and connecting skills. Integration
of new media literacies into instructional programmes help students gain
baseline ICT skills and&nbsp;learn beyond the confines of the classrooms.</p>
<p>Our school embraces e-Pedagogy, which involves the use of technology to
facilitate active learning, fostering a participatory, connected, and reflective
classroom environment to cultivate future-ready learners. This approach
emphasises that our students are at the core of our educational practices.
By integrating active learning with technology, we prioritise learning
activities and interactions in our instructional design. We leverage suitable
e-Pedagogy learning experience types to achieve desired outcomes, including
the development of 21st Century Competencies (21CC), Digital Literacy,
and Technological Skills. Additionally, our teaching and learning practices
are informed by research in the learning sciences, demonstrating how technology
enhances the educational experience. Furthermore, our educators seamlessly
integrate technology into both physical and digital learning spaces, creating
diverse learning contexts for our students.</p>
