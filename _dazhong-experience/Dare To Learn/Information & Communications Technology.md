### Information &amp; Communications Technology

Aligned with the school’s vision, the school seeks to develop self-directed learners who are engaged in learning through integrating technology into instructional programmes. ICT is harnessed to integrate content knowledge with, in particular – the component of&nbsp;_Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills_&nbsp;– to equip students with creating, curating and connecting skills. Integration of new media literacies into instructional programmes help students gain baseline ICT skills and&nbsp;learn beyond the confines of the classrooms.

Guided by the SLS Pedagogical Framework, teachers design their lesson to provide students with various types of learning experience, Acquisition, Collaboration, Inquiry and Discussion. Such learning experiences allow students to work together as a group through collaborative learning, experiencing discussion to deepen their mastery of the knowledge, acquire skills and concept through the discerning of patterns as well as through investigation.
