<h3>Information &amp; Communications Technology (ICT)</h3>
<p>In line with the<strong> EdTech Masterplan 2030</strong> and the <strong>21st Century Competencies </strong>framework,
the school aims to cultivate <strong>self-directed</strong> and <strong>collaborative learners </strong>who
are actively engaged in their learning and proficient collaborators. This
is achieved by integrating EdTech into the core curriculum and instructional
programmes, harnessing ICT to integrate content knowledge with, in particular
â€“ the development of<strong>&nbsp;Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills</strong>.</p>

<p>Central to this approach is the use of <strong>SLS as a one-stop hub</strong>,
and the strategic development of student <strong>self-directedness</strong> and <strong>collaboration skills</strong> using
EdTech from Primary 1 to Primary 6, in gradation to their cognitive growth.</p>
<p>Our teachers enables the abovementioned by embracing <strong>e-Pedagogy</strong>,
which involves the use of technology to facilitate active learning, fostering
a participatory, connected, and reflective classroom environment to cultivate
future-ready learners.</p>

<p>By integrating <strong>active learning with technology</strong>, we prioritise
learning activities and interactions in our instructional design. We leverage
suitable e-Pedagogy learning experience types to achieve desired outcomes,
including the development of 21st Century Competencies (21CC), Digital
Literacy, and Technological Skills. Additionally, our teaching and learning
practices are guided by principles of the <strong>EdTech Pedagogical Scaffold</strong> and <strong>Key Applications of Technology</strong>,
demonstrating how technology enhances the educational experience. In Dazhong,
we aim to <strong>seamlessly integrate technology into both physical and digital learning spaces</strong>,
creating diverse learning contexts for our students.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is to ensure that students are well-equipped with the digital competencies
to thrive in an increasingly technology-saturated future.</p>

<p>Our Primary 1 students learn to familiarize their fingers with the keyboard.
They learn through their own pace and learning happens anytime and anywhere.
They are not confined by the school hours but can also continue their practice
at home.</p>
