<h3>Mother Tongue Languages</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>Developing effective bilingual communicators</p>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>To nurture self-directed learners who can exercise metacognitive reflection
on own learning and seek self-improvement, to become proficient users of
their respective Mother Tongue Languages (MTLs).</p>
<h4>Key Approaches</h4>
<p><strong>Excite:</strong> In the MTL classrooms, students’ learning will
be activated, so that they are excited, aware and eager to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Engage:</strong> Students are engaged to learn actively as they
enjoy and learn optimally with their teachers and peers in seamless Blended
Learning experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Empower:</strong> Students are empowered to own and self-direct
their MTL learning based on their readiness and interest. They can also
use and apply acquired MTL content and skills to serve and advocate for
the causes they believe in (e.g. ALP – GreenMakers@Dazhong), and leading
their peers, school and the community to be part of the movement. All of
which are anchored on strong school and CCE values.

<h4><strong>Department Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Mother Tongue Fortnight Programme (MTFP)</strong>
</p>
<p>Every year, for two weeks, our students delve into the vibrant tapestry
of language, culture, and identity. From lively drama preparation to immersive
traditional experiences, every activity served as a gateway to understanding
and cherishing our roots. Beyond academic enrichment, our aim was to cultivate
a profound appreciation for our mother tongues and cultures, and we're
thrilled to witness the blossoming of cultural pride among our participants.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES)</strong> 
<br>Our school seeks to evoke in pupils a deep interest in the learning of
the Mother Tongue language through enabling them to appreciate the beauty
of cultural performances. Through CPES, pupils are provided with opportunities
to be exposed to the different ethnic cultures through folk songs, poetry
recitation, storytelling based on classics, theatre experiences etc. Through
these cultural activities, the school seeks to enable the pupils to appreciate
the beauty underlying each language and hence enthuse them to further seek
to deepen their learning of the language.</p>

<p><strong>MTL Cultural Camp</strong>
</p>
<p>MTL Cultural Camp is one of the platforms to encourage students to appreciate
their own language and culture and also have exposure to other MTL and
traditional cultures. The programme seeks to promote the usage of MTL and
cultural appreciation in an authentic setting.</p>

<p><strong>The MTL Reading Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Aligned to school vision and mission, our department implemented The MTL
Reading Programme, which consisted of a series of reading activities throughout
the year for all students. We aimed to 1) excite, engage and nurture students’
love and interest for MTL languages so as to establish a strong foundation
for continual learning; 2) develop students’ awareness of practising their
self-directed learnings while developing the habits of reading MTL books;
3) cultivate critical readings skills and empower them to share good reads
with peers; 4) broaden students’ language skills and hone SEL and 21st
CC skills; 5) cultivate students to be serving leaders to advocate peers
or younger readers; 5) strengthen students’ links to our Asian heritage
so that they are aware and can better appreciate our cultures as a concern
citizen.</p>

</div>
<p>The reading activities were:</p>
<p>a) Reading Corner @ Classroom</p>
<p>During the MTL library periods, our teachers encouraged students to choose
their favourite MTL storybooks from the library. These books were loaned
and used to set up the MTL Classroom Library Corner in each MTL class.
Two MTL student librarians from each class were appointed to monitor the
loan of these story books. Books at the MTL Classroom Library Corner were
refreshed once every term.</p>
<p>b) I Read and I Wonder</p>
<p>Our teachers recommended a series of interesting storybooks via video
and post them on the “I Read and I Wonder” Padlet Page: https://padlet.com/dzpsofficial/Chinese_Story.
<br>Students could borrow these books in the library and after they read the
books, they could complete reading activities such as making bookmarks,
drawing their favourite characters or scene, drawing comics, designing
posters to share a good read.</p>
<p>c) A1 Got Talent</p>
<p>Students had the chance to showcase their talents, such as performing
short skits, choral reading and role playing, based on the MTL books they
read. A1 Got Talent was conducted as post-exam activities during Term 2
and 4 via SLS or in the classrooms.</p>
<p>d) Read With You</p>
<p>Selected P4 to P6 students recorded themselves reading a storybook and
posted the videos on the “Read With You” Padlet page, for the P1 and P2
students to access. These videos were broadcasted in the library and canteen
during recess for our P1 and P2 students. For each of these videos, QR
codes will be generated and attached inside the books.</p>

<p><strong>Learn for Life Programme (LLP)</strong>
</p>
<p>Speech and Drama</p>
<p>In Dazhong Primary school, we provide opportunities and resources to build
joyful learning experiences during the Mother Tongue Language lessons.
Based on the chosen curriculum from P1 to P6, Mother Tongue Language teachers
used costumes and props in class for students to role-play the scenes they
read in the text passages. These lessons were designed for students to
deepen their understanding of history and culture through the cultural
experiences. With these joyful learning experiences and a firm foundation
in Mother Tongue Language, every Dazhong student will be motivated to have
a better understanding of their own Mother Tongue Language.</p>

<p>During Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) lessons, student would acquire
a basic understanding of how to speak the two target languages in less
formal situations. At the end of the course, students would be able to
hold simple conversations in various common situations with a native Chinese
Language or Malay Language speaker. CCM also aims to bridge the divide
between the languages and strengthen racial harmony.</p>
<h4>Festive Celebrations</h4>

</p>
<p>At Dazhong Primary School, the Chinese New Year celebration is dazzled

martial arts showcased the school's cultural diversity. Students also participated

to foster cultural understanding and create cherished memories of unity

<p><strong>Hari Raya Celebration</strong>
</p>
<p>Hari Raya is celebrated annually to advocate the culture of acceptance,
especially amongst the different racial groups. From engaging in hands-on
activities like food tasting and trying on traditional Malay costumes during
recess to enjoying a spectacular concert performance during assembly, our
students were immersed in the joyous festivities. Further enriching their
understanding of Malay culture, they explored craftwork during CCE periods,
fostering a deeper appreciation for our diverse society. These experiences
aim to promote cultural harmony and cross-cultural understanding among
our students, reinforcing Dazhong Primary School's commitment to celebrating
diversity and unity.</p>
