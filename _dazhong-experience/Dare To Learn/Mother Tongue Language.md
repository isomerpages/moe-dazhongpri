<h3>Mother Tongue Languages</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/MT%2001.png">
</div>
<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>Developing effective bilingual communicators</p>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>To nurture self-directed learners who can exercise metacognitive reflection
on own learning and seek self-improvement, to become proficient users of
their respective Mother Tongue Languages (MTLs).</p>
<h4>Key Approaches</h4>
<p><strong>Excite:</strong> In the MTL classrooms, students’ learning will
be activated, so that they are excited, aware and eager to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Engage:</strong> Students are engaged to learn actively as they
enjoy and learn optimally with their teachers and peers in seamless Blended
Learning experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Empower:</strong> Students are empowered to own and self-direct
their MTL learning based on their readiness and interest. They can also
use and apply acquired MTL content and skills to serve and advocate for
the causes they believe in (e.g. ALP – GreenMakers@Dazhong), and leading
their peers, school and the community to be part of the movement. All of
which are anchored on strong school and CCE values.</p>
<p><strong><u>Peaks of Excellence</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Each year, the MTL department offers various platforms for students to
develop their potential, showcase their talents, and learn from enriching
experiences. At Dazhong, we believe that every student is a high-potential
learner!</p>

<br><strong>Cultural Appreciation Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mother Tongue Fortnight Programme (MTFP) </strong>
<br>MTFP Part 1 - Chinese New Year (CNY) 2022 and Cultural (Art) Appreciation</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/MT%2012.jpg">
</div>
<p>
<br>The MTFP Part 1 cum 2022 CNY Celebrations was organized by the Mother
Tongue Languages (MTL) Department.</p>
<p>In 2022, the programme was designed, in collaboration with other departments,
with age-appropriate activities that were aligned to the school’s new focus
and directions. Students were engaged and empowered to put into action
their will to support a sustainable environment, while learning about the
cultural aspects of CNY.
<br>During the four-day programme (26 to 31 Jan 2022), the Cultural (Art)
Appreciation activities during MTL lessons and eve of CNY, students made
handicrafts with recycled materials, via SLS lesson packages.
<br>Through these activities, students exhibited self-directed learning, responsibility
and acceptance. Their perseverance and aim for excellence led them to create
creative artifacts.
<br>Students also had opportunities to exhibit the attributes of being concerned
citizens and serving leaders for the community, by participating in the
fundraising for the Lions Clubs of Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Mother Tongue Fortnight Programme (MTFP) </strong>
<br>MTFP Part 2 - Racial Harmony Day</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/MT%2013.jpg">
</div>
<p>
<br>The objective of the 2022 MTL Fortnight Part 2 programme was to develop
appreciation and love for learning one’s Mother Tongue Language.</p>
<p>The school celebrated Racial Harmony by learning more about traditional
art, cultivating students’ understanding of the cultural stories behind
the traditional art, and applying MTL language to celebrate the cultural
diversity in Singapore. We also wanted to celebrate the diversity of ethnic
cultures and emphasize the importance of Racial Harmony Day. This will
serve to enhance our school Racial Harmony and cultural interaction index.
<br>We also hoped that besides understanding and appreciating their own culture
and language, our students would be more motivated to love and care for
our environment too.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES)</strong>
</p>
<p>Under CPES (CL), schools can choose Chinese performances suitable for
students from the recommended plays. Students can go out of school and
enter the theatre to enrich their theatre experience, so that students
can feel the charm of Chinese theatre and experience the beauty of culture
and Chinese.
<br>Our school seeks to evoke in pupils a deep interest in the learning of
the Mother Tongue language through enabling them to appreciate the beauty
of cultural performances. Through CPES, pupils are provided with opportunities
to be exposed to the different ethnic cultures through folk songs, poetry
recitation, storytelling based on classics, theatre experiences etc. Through
these cultural activities, the school seeks to enable the pupils to appreciate
the beauty underlying each language and hence enthuse them to further seek
to deepen their learning of the language.</p>

</div>
<p>For CPES (ML), the Malay Language students had the opportunity to learn
about the rich cultural heritage of the Malay community through an Angklung
performance and learning to play the instrument.
<br>The students were introduced to the unique Malay musical instrument made
of bamboos. They learnt that a performance will not do with only a single
Angklung player as the instrument produces only a singular note on its
own. Through this interactive programme, the students not only learn to
appreciate Angklung music better by playing the instrument in a hands-on
session, they also learnt the beauty of team work as they produce harmonious
melodies as a group.</p>

<p>MTL Cultural Camp is one of the platforms to encourage students to appreciate
their own language and culture and also have exposure to other MTL and
traditional cultures. The programme seeks to promote the usage of MTL and
cultural appreciation in an authentic setting.

<p><strong>Other Festive Celebrations</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Chinese New year Celebration</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/MT%2018.jpg">
</div>
<p>The theme of our Chinese New Year’s celebration was ‘Dare to Shine’ New
Year. Our students were encouraged to perform acts of kindness for others,
while celebrating the Dare-To-Learn spirit. This is in line with the launch
of "Shine On! 85 Acts of Kindness" in Term 1.
<br>One week prior to Chinese New Year, our students had the opportunity to
learn more about the festival through various cultural activities, while
doing their part for the environment and the community. These included
a SLS lesson for students to observe and document what they see, hear,
smell, touch and taste during this festive season. Through this activity,
they honed their self-directed learning skills by exploring, documenting
and reflecting on what they learnt about the festival. Students were also
engaged in cultural activities during their CCE lessons, such as the making
of red packets using recyclable items.
<br>Our CNY concert was held on 19 January 2023 in the school hall where students
watched the Chinese New Year concert live! Our partners - the School Advisory
Committee (SAC) members and the seniors from Lion Befrienders also joined
us in this joyous occasion.
<br>Before the concert, our SAC members and Parent Support Group (PSG) members,
planted trees in our school. This event kickstarted our school's 85th Anniversary
celebrations. It was also our way of showing kindness to the environment.
The entire process was recorded and showcased during our CNY concert, so
that our students would be aware and further inspired to care and be advocates
for the Green Movement.
<br>Students also had the opportunity to exhibit the attributes of being concerned
citizens and serving leaders for the community, by participating in the
fundraising for the Lions Clubs of Singapore.
<br>This was indeed a meaningful and joyous occasion for all in Dazhong!</p>
<p><strong>Hari Raya Celebration</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/MT%2019.jpg">
</div>
<p>Hari Raya is celebrated annually to advocate the culture of acceptance,
especially amongst the different racial groups. The celebration focused
on cultural appreciation and creating a sense of awareness in students
to promote racial harmony through cultural activities. It is also an opportunity
for the staff and students to inspire one another to celebrate in a sustainable
way.
<br>With these in mind, the celebration was intentionally designed for students
to be inculcated with the dispositions of being self-directed learners,
concerned citizens and serving leaders.
<br>The key aim of the Hari Raya Celebration to excite the students with pre-celebration
activities and the programme on that day, so as to engage them to learn
and understand the Malay culture, and empower them to celebrate the festival
in a sustainable way, just like how the school celebrated CNY earlier in
the year, through Dare to Eidspire video and activities.
<br>With this, the enduring understanding of celebrating all festivals in
an inspiring manner through sustainability is inculcated among our students.</p>
<p><strong>Deepavali Celebration</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/MT%2024.jpeg">
</div>
<p>Our theme for Deepavali 2022 is ‘The Inspiring Musical’. Students and
teachers worked together to produce a musical, which educated students
and staff about the festival, while driving the message of celebrating
the festival in a sustainable fashion.
<br>As Green Makers, our students used recycled materials to design Diya,
Thoranams and cards to appreciate bus captains, during their CCE lessons.
Students also participated in various recess booth activities to learn
more about Deepavali. The booths were managed by selected P3-P6 students.
This sharpened their leadership skills and oratorical skills. The school
also had a mass assembly and celebrated Deepavali in the hall.
<br>The Dazhong family certainly gained a better understanding about Deepavali
through our celebration. This then would empower everyone to practice the
value of Acceptance in our speech and actions and uphold the peace and
harmony in the nation. Dazhong, Dare to Inspire!</p>
<p><strong>The MTL Reading Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Aligned to school vision and mission, our department implemented The MTL
Reading Programme, which consisted of a series of reading activities throughout
the year for all students. We aimed to 1) excite, engage and nurture students’
love and interest for MTL languages so as to establish a strong foundation
for continual learning; 2) develop students’ awareness of practising their
self-directed learnings while developing the habits of reading MTL books;
3) cultivate critical readings skills and empower them to share good reads
with peers; 4) broaden students’ language skills and hone SEL and 21st
CC skills; 5) cultivate students to be serving leaders to advocate peers
or younger readers; 5) strengthen students’ links to our Asian heritage
so that they are aware and can better appreciate our cultures as a concern
citizen.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/MT%2020.png">
</div>
<p>The reading activities were:</p>
<p>a) Reading Corner @ Classroom</p>
<p>During the MTL library periods, our teachers encouraged students to choose
their favourite MTL storybooks from the library. These books were loaned
and used to set up the MTL Classroom Library Corner in each MTL class.
Two MTL student librarians from each class were appointed to monitor the
loan of these story books. Books at the MTL Classroom Library Corner were
refreshed once every term.</p>
<p>b) I Read and I Wonder</p>
<p>Our teachers recommended a series of interesting storybooks via video
and post them on the “I Read and I Wonder” Padlet Page: https://padlet.com/dzpsofficial/Chinese_Story.
<br>Students could borrow these books in the library and after they read the
books, they could complete reading activities such as making bookmarks,
drawing their favourite characters or scene, drawing comics, designing
posters to share a good read.</p>
<p>c) A1 Got Talent</p>
<p>Students had the chance to showcase their talents, such as performing
short skits, choral reading and role playing, based on the MTL books they
read. A1 Got Talent was conducted as post-exam activities during Term 2
and 4 via SLS or in the classrooms.</p>
<p>d) Read With You</p>
<p>Selected P4 to P6 students recorded themselves reading a storybook and
posted the videos on the “Read With You” Padlet page, for the P1 and P2
students to access. These videos were broadcasted in the library and canteen
during recess for our P1 and P2 students. For each of these videos, QR
codes will be generated and attached inside the books.</p>

<p><strong>Learn for Life Programme (LLP)</strong>
</p>
<p>Speech and Drama</p>
<p>In 2022, we planned to provide opportunities and resources to build joyful
learning experiences during the Mother Tongue Language lessons. Based on
the chosen curriculum from P1 to P6, Mother Tongue Language teachers used
costumes and props in class for students to role-play the scenes they read
in the text passages. These lessons were designed for students to deepen
their understanding of history and culture through the cultural experiences.
With these joyful learning experiences and a firm foundation in Mother
Tongue Language, every Dazhong student will be motivated to have a better
understanding of their own Mother Tongue Language.</p>
<p><strong>Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM)</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/MT%2023.jpg">
</div>
<p>During Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) lessons, student would acquire
a basic understanding of how to speak the two target languages in less
formal situations. At the end of the course, students would be able to
hold simple conversations in various common situations with a native Chinese
Language or Malay Language speaker. CCM also aims to bridge the divide
between the languages and strengthen racial harmony.</p>
