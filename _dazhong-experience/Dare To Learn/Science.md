<h4>Vision:</h4>
<p>Inspiring Curiosity, Inquiring like Scientists, Innovating to Serve Science</p>
<h4>Mission:</h4>
<p>To nurture self-directed learners who are curious, inquiring like Scientists,
and a passion to apply Science to serve the community.</p>
<h4>Key Approaches and Milestone Programmes to bring about Science Vision of Inspiring Curiosity, Inquiring like Scientists, Innovating to Serve</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Inspire (Excite)</strong> – Dazhong Science believes in promoting
students’ natural curiosity, by providing opportunities for students to
enjoy the learning of Science, by seeing relevance to everyday phenomena,
and meaning in how Science is applied to solve global challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Students learn to be Aware of Science around us, through Experiential
Learning such as outdoor trails, Assembly Programmes, and Recess Activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dazhong's green areas are engineered for self-directed learning (Eco-Garden,
Eco-Pond, Inspiration Space, Butterfly Garden, Dazhong Sky Garden, Aeroponics
(<a href="http://for.edu.sg/aeroponics" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">http://for.edu.sg/aeroponics</a>)
to serve as the 3rd teacher to allow appreciation and learning of nature
around us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students learn how current affairs are linked to Science concepts that
they learn, for example how reused incineration ash and landfill trash
could be used in reclamation for Tuas Port.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:80%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/sci2.png">
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Inquire (Engage)</strong> – Experiences are provided in the spirit
of scientific inquiry, for students to observe, and evaluate claims and
ideas critically based on evidence.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dazhong Science uses the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract approach, where students
do hands-on experiments (Concrete) before linking it to theory in the form
of diagrams and words (Pictorial and Abstract)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As part of Inquiry, the Predict-Observe-Explain frame is used to actively
engage students in the scientific process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plus-Minus-Interesting is a routine used to stretch students’ critical
thinking: e.g. What if everything in the world was waterproof? (Plus) What
would be good about it? (Minus) What would be bad about that? (Interesting)
Anything interesting that would result?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dazhong Science has a Blended Inquiry approach, where Info-Comms-Technology
(ICT) is blended with hands-on experiments to enhance the learning experience.
For example, students are equipped with iPads as they go on a nature learning
trail, and they can scan the QR Code of Info-Tags in our Eco-Garden to
find out more about the Plants.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Innovate (Evaluate)</strong> – After being Inspired, and learning
through Inquiry, students are then encouraged to apply science to generate
creative solutions to solve real-world problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Science of Total Defence: Students learn about the Science of Singapore’s
6 Pillars of Total Defence, with the theme of “Together, We Keep Singapore
Strong” against the Covid pandemic, and Awareness of the Causes and Effects
of Climate Change, how they can take Action as a Concerned Citizen, and
being serving leaders by Advocating for others to do their part. Recess
booths showed different aspects of Science and Technology in Total Defence,
including Upcycled materials for creative toys, and even an interactive
Thermal Camera booth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students use scientific concepts they have learnt to create models and
toys to demonstrate.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Stretch Programmes</h4>
<p>Students with greater interest and aptitude in Science are given opportunities
to further their learning, such as through E2K Science, the NUS High Science
Oratorical Competition, and the Singapore Primary Science Olympiad.</p>
<p><strong><u>1. E2K Science</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The E2K Science Programme aims to develop scientific inquiry skills and
21st-century competencies such as resilience, critical thinking, and effective
communication among high-ability primary pupils. The programme employs
twelve pedagogies designed to empower students to become independent learners.
Key strategies include encouraging multiple solutions, using relevant tasks,
fostering active student participation, and promoting independent thinking
through inquiry-based methods.</p>
<p>In Primary 4 and 5, students are presented with open and challenging scientific
tasks that excite their curiosity and stretch their thinking. They engage
with scientifically oriented questions, learning to evaluate claims critically
based on evidence. The programme empowers students to be self-directed
learners, curious about how things work and keen to apply their scientific
knowledge. They gain awareness of how everyday phenomena connect to scientific
concepts and global challenges, think logically, and provide plausible
explanations for phenomena. Additionally, students advocate for the joy
of learning science by preparing stations for an E2K Challenge Day. The
cognitive outcomes include discovering interests, developing strengths,
and making meaningful connections, while affective outcomes focus on curiosity,
commitment, adaptability, and collaboration.</p>
<p><strong><u>2. Competitions</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our school provides students with opportunities to participate in a variety
of science and environmental competitions, showcasing their passion and
proficiency in these areas. Students have the chance to engage in the Abbott
Young Scientist Award, the NUS High Oratorical Challenge with presentations
on topics like "Wearable Tech" and "Animal Rights," and the Singapore Primary
Science Olympiad. Our innovative use of thermal cameras and commitment
to environmental education have been recognised by the Ministry of Education.
We also support participation in the Sembcorp Green Wave Competition, where
students work on projects related to waste management and energy conservation,
as well as the National Youth Upcycling Movement, Sustainable South West,
and Green Schools initiatives. Additionally, our involvement in the NParks
Community in Bloom programme and the "Nature through Drama" initiative
helps promote science communication within the community.
