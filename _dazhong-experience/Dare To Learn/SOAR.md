At Level I, all students will go through key experience in Dazhong’s Learn for Life Programme (LLP) (Arts Education) and Applied Learning Programme (ALP) (Green Makers). These are highly engaging programmes that provide foundational skills and tools for all students. Various Recess activities are also conducted to engage students with greater interests, such as a Thermal Camera booth for students to see real-life applications of Heat and Temperature from Science.

At level III, some students with greater interest and commitment are provided the opportunity to experience alternative opportunities. At Dazhong, this includes Vivita programme, E2K Mathematics, and E2K Science, as well as various Mother Tongue programmes.

**ALP Vivita**

18 Dazhong students who had expressed greater interest and commitment for the level-wide Green Makers ALP, had a Blended Learning experience with Vivita Makerspace – Zoom coaching sessions, and a Learning Journey to Vivistop @ Orchard, sponsored by Hong Leong Asia. The students created “Trashure from Trash”, like weaving cloth from used clothes, making plastic bottle pets and stationary holders, and culminating in a final project that combined all their previously learnt skills to make a unique bottle holder and sling completely from used resources, thereby giving these materials a second life and more.
