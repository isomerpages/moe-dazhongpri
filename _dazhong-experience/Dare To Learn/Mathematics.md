<p>Mathematics in Dazhong is shaped by our direction of Mastery of Maths
for Life. This takes place in two ways: (1) Cultivating the Joy of Learning,
and (2) Building Confidence through Mastery. Along this direction, key
milestone programmes are designed to promote conceptual understanding by
sense-making through stories.</p>
<p>The broad aims of Mathematics education in Dazhong are aligned to that
of the National curriculum. They are to enable students to:</p>
<p></p>
<p>-&nbsp; acquire &amp; apply mathematical concepts &amp; skills;</p>
<p>-&nbsp; develop cognitive &amp; metacognitive skills through a mathematical
approach to problem solving; &amp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;-&nbsp; develop positive attitudes towards&nbsp;Mathematics.</p>

</div>
<p>To develop our students to acquire and apply the necessary skills, concepts,
processes, attitudes and metacognition towards learning Mathematics, the
department carefully designs and plans suitable learning experiences (LEs)
both in and out of the classroom. Such LEs help students to activate their
learning and promote critical and inventive thinking. At suitable milestone
checkpoints, we assess and monitor their learning.</p>
<p><strong><u>Department Key Approaches &amp; Programmes</u></strong>
<br>The department teaching principles are aligned to the Singapore Teaching
Practice. The key principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Teaching is for learning; learning is for understanding; understanding
is for reasoning and applying and ultimately problem solving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teaching should build on students’ knowledge; being cognisant of students’
interests and experiences; and engage them in active &amp; reflective learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teaching should connect learning to the real world, harness ICT tools
&amp; emphasize 21st century competencies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Teaching is an interactive and iterative process that is focused on students’
learning. Teachers use a range of teaching approaches to engage students
in learning, collect various sources of feedback to inform them of their
instruction and the students’ learning, and then make informed decisions
on their instructional practices to enhance learning.</p>
<p>Our key pedagogical approaches include:</p>
<p><strong>Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract Approach</strong>: The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract
(C-P-A) Approach engages our students in the process of deep and active
learning and the mastery of mathematical concepts and skills in our classrooms.
Students participate in activities involving the use of concrete materials
and pictorial representations or diagrams to acquire full conceptual understanding
in Mathematics, moving through the three stages – enactive, iconic and
symbolic – as posited in a research-based Theory of Cognitive Development
by Jerome Bruner.</p>

<p><strong>Authentic learning experiences</strong>: In line with our Mathematics
Department’s approach of&nbsp;promoting the love for Mathematics learning
through authentic learning experiences and our belief that our students
learn best through purposeful play, we provide a wide range of learning
experiences for students in our Mathematics classrooms. For instance, when
teaching the topic of ‘Angles’ to middle-primary students, we provide our
students with opportunities to find angles in the environment and use a
‘paper right angle’ to identify right angles, obtuse angles and acute angles.</p>

<p><strong><em>Metacognitive Strategies:</em></strong> Metacognition, or the
ability to think about one's own thinking, is a crucial skill in the realm
of Mathematics teaching and learning. When teaching problem solving, students
engage in group discussions to share their thought processes as well as
reflect on their problem-solving strategies and decisions, promoting metacognitive
awareness. By monitoring their own thinking processes, students gained
self-awareness, essential for ongoing learning and growth. Additionally,
it supported metacognitive regulation by enabling adjustments based on
feedback and experience.</p>

<p><strong><em>George Polya’s 4-Step Approach to Problem Solving</em></strong>:
The S.T.E.P Thinking Routine was adopted from George Polya’s four-step
approach for problem solving. It was intentionally created to scaffold
our students’ critical and problem solving skills when tackling heuristics
and problem sums. Students will make use of the four steps in the S.T.E.P
Thinking Routine when solving Mathematics problems –&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>tudy
the problem,&nbsp;<strong>T</strong>hink of a plan,&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>xecute
the plan,&nbsp;<strong>P</strong>ause and reflect. The steps emphasize
4 key principles:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Understand the problem
<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Devise a plan
<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Carry out the plan
<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Review/Extend</p>
<p>The S.T.E.P Thinking Routine is incorporated into the design of our Progressive
Approach to Teaching Heuristic and Skills (P.A.T.H.S) Package, a termly
package that introduces two or three heuristic skills to students progressively.</p>

<p><strong><em>EdTech Pedagogical Scaffold (SLS PS)</em></strong>:&nbsp;The
department also adopts the EdTech PS in lesson planning and delivery. Relevant
ICT platforms/tools are used to activate learning, promote thinking and
discussion, and to visualise students’ thinking are researched and designed
via our Professional Learning Time (PLT) and implemented in our lessons.</p>

<p>Learning Mathematics is more than just learning concepts and skills. Equally
important are the cognitive and metacognitive process skills. The processes
are learned through carefully constructed learning experiences enacted
via our department programmes:</p>
<h4>Milestone Programmes:</h4>
<p><strong><em>National Day Celebrations with Mathematics Exploration Week (MEW)</em></strong>:&nbsp;As
part of the school’s National Day celebrations, the Mathematics Department
