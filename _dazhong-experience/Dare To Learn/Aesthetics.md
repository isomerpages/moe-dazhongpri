**Learning for Life Programme: LLP**

Learning for Life Programme (LLP)- Arts Education Programme (AEP) @ Dazhong

AEP@DZ allows students access to quality learning opportunities that cover the four Arts strands consisting of drama, visual arts, music, and dance which are aligned to raise their critical and inventive thinking competencies.

Engagement in AEP@DZ provides the sense of wonder and joy of learning in our students. For P1 to P3 levels, our students are given the exposure to learn music through String Ensemble (violin) Music Programme. P1 &amp; P2 students undergo Speech and Drama classes and P3-P6 students experience a myriad of visual arts experiences such as the Paper Mache, Mosaic Art, Batik and Ceramics Painting. Besides the Visual Arts, P5 students learn various ethnic dances too. All P6 students will carry out project work using the skills they have acquired and work together as a team to present a performance in school. The progression of skills acquired over 6 years serves as a solid foundation which our students can tap on for their secondary education and beyond. The AEP@DZ enhances self-directed learning, collaboration, and perseverance in students. They become gracious citizens who are appreciative of the arts and seek to serve the community with their artistic talents and skills.

**AEP@Dazhong is made up of 4 main strands namely:**

\-&nbsp; &nbsp; Speech &amp; Drama (P1 &amp; P2)<br>
\-&nbsp; &nbsp; Music (Violin Ensemble) - (P1 to P3)<br>
\-&nbsp; &nbsp; Dance (P5)<br>
\-&nbsp; &nbsp; Visual Arts (P1 to P6)
