<h4>CDAC Tuition </h4>
<p>In collaboration with CDAC (Chinese Development Assistance Council), we
have introduced new tuition classes at Dazhong Primary School, which started
on Saturday, 23 March 2024. The CDAC is one of four self-help groups (SHGs)
in Singapore. The CDACâ€™s mandate is to serve underprivileged individuals
and families in the Chinese community.</p>
<p>These classes are designed to provide an extra layer of support to students
who may benefit from additional academic assistance. By working closely
with CDAC, we aim to create an enriching educational experience that caters
to the diverse needs of our students.</p>
