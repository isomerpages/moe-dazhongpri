<h3>Junior Orchestra</h3><p><strong>CCA Overview</strong></p><p>Dazhong Primary School is currently the only primary school in Singapore offering a full Junior Orchestra (JO). At present, the members of the Orchestra stand at 100 members strong. One of the key aims of this programme is to uplift students through music and by providing opportunities that they may not have access to.</p><p><strong>Objectives of Dazhong Junior Orchestra:</strong></p><p>Besides equipping our JO students with musical knowledge and 21cc skills, JO programme is set up to:<br></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>uplift and transform young lives through music (social change).</p></li><li><p>provide our students opportunities and multiple pathways based on their strengths, interests and talents.</p></li></ul><p>Junior Orchestra is an extension of the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) and is part of the Arts Education Programme@Dazhong (AEP@Dazhong). As part of AEP@Dazhong, all Primary 1 to 3 students go through the String Ensemble (violin) music programme. Students who show an aptitude and interest in the performing arts are invited to further develop their skills and deepen their passion through JO. The JO programme has brought about positive outcomes for our students. They are more attuned to their social and emotional competencies and their self-efficacy has seen positive growth. Our Junior Orchestra students had performed in many outreach community platforms like at Hong Kah North Community Club National Day events, National Gallery, SYF Arts Presentation as well as President Charity Show. Our students are featured in the Straits Times, Lian He Zao Bao as well as Suria TV.</p><p><strong>Junior Orchestra as Uplift Force – Inclusive Music approach</strong></p><p>Taking an inclusive approach, the Junior Orchestra provides students with access to learning an individual instrument and strengthen music education. In order to create an inclusive music environment with meaningful learning experiences for all students, teachers leverage the school’s value of Acceptance to instill the importance of this value by teaching students how to accept all students regardless of their backgrounds or abilities.</p><p>With the development of Music curriculum at Dazhong Primary School, our students are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to explore further their interests in the various fields of instrumental playing and in their secondary school of choice or through Direct School Admission (DSA). Some of our students have also been identified for the SOTA Temasek Foundation Award for Arts Development. Our students have been given opportunities to participate in school and community events, collaborate with other schools, and perform at community and/or national level.</p><p>Dazhong Junior Orchestra has collaborated with Methodist Girls’ School (MGS) since 2018. The MGS students have inspired our Dazhong students with their talents, knowlwedge and skills in music making. Our students have benefited from this collaboration with MGS as it has helped them to become more confident, focused and disciplined. In 2023, Dazhong Junior Orchestra collaborates with NUS Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music (NUS YST) through sessions in which YST students are guided towards coaching our Dazhong students through their undergraduate module, Orchestral Pedagogy. This culminates in a Children’s Concert in which our JO students perform side by side with YST students in a family-oriented concert at the Conservatory Orchestra Hall at NUS YST.</p><p>The school also firmly believes that music can bring about social change and has helped transform the lives of many of our students. Many JO students have joined the JO alumni and exemplified the vision of serving leaders by giving back to their juniors by coaching and mentoring them. Junior Orchestra Programme helps to inspire students to share their love of music and bring joy to the community and all.</p><p><strong>CCA Schedule</strong><br>Tuesdays, 7.40 a.m. to 9.40 a.m.<br>Thursdays, 2.20 p.m. to 4.20 p.m.</p><p><strong>JO Advisor:</strong><br>Mrs Dawn Kuah (Lead Teacher, Music)</p><p><strong>Teachers-in-Charge:</strong><br>Mr Edwin Lim (Overall Teacher-in-Charge)<br>Mdm Sun I-feng (Sectional IC – Strings)<br>Mdm Chen Liqin (Sectional IC – Percussion)<br>Miss Justina Tan (Sectional IC – Winds)<br>Miss Crystalbelle Chang<br>Mdm Muneera Abu Bakar<br>Mrs Shereen Chan<br>Mdm Humairah Rahman<br>Mrs Charmaine Chia<br>Miss Lee Hon Choo<br>Mdm Izni Nasihah</p><p><strong>Instructors:</strong><br>Mr Adrian Chiang, Main Conductor<br>Mr Damien Kee, Assistant Conductor (Strings)<br>Miss Lydia Wong, Violin Instructor<br>Miss Jolene Goh, Viola Instructor<br>Miss Ophelia Toh, Cello &amp; Double Bass Instructor<br>Mr Ralph Lim, Wind Instructor<br>Mr Joseph Teo, Brass Instructor<br>Miss Angeline Wee, Percussion Instructor</p><hr><p><strong>Achievements / Peak of Excellence / CCA in Actions</strong></p><p><strong>PAssionArts Festival Village and National Day Carnival at Hong Kah North Community Club</strong></p><p>In honour of our nation's 58th Birthday, our talented Dazhong Junior Orchestra Strings students delivered an awe-inspiring performance at the Hong Kah North Community Club on 5 August 2023, Saturday.
