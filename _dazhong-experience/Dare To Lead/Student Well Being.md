### Student Well-Being<br>Peer Support &amp; Relationships (PSR) + Cyber Wellness (CW)

#### Vision:

Every Dazhong student is a Peer Supporter and advocate for Cyber Wellness.

#### Mission:

To create a&nbsp;**Caring**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Enabling**&nbsp;School environment by:

*   Empowering students to be&nbsp;**positive influencers and leaders**
*   Bridging&nbsp;**the adult and student divide**&nbsp;to strengthen our student’ safety nets
*   Creating a&nbsp;**protective factor**&nbsp;for students at risk through the building of positive relationships
*   Contributing to a positive school&nbsp;**Culture of Care**.

  

#### Key Approaches for Student Well-Being @ DZPS:

In order to create a&nbsp;**Caring and Enabling**&nbsp;School environment and strengthen our school’s&nbsp;**Culture of Care**, the school looks into the various aspects of&nbsp;**Student Well-Being**&nbsp;through these areas:

*   Positive Teacher-Student Relationships
*   Positive Peer Support &amp; Relationships&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*   Mental Health
*   Cyber Wellness
*   Students with Needs

It is a whole-school effort to equip all students with the necessary skills to support their own well-being as well as strengthen their school support systems (both offline &amp; online). This is further supported by our teachers. A two-prong approach is thus adopted by our school to address this:

**1\. Level 1 PSR and CW (All Students)**<br>**_DZPS 3E&nbsp; - Excite &amp; Engage_**

*   Cyber Wellness Weeks (as part of NE events - Total Defence Day, IFD, Racial Harmony, National Day)
*   PSR infused as part of School Programmes (e.g. School Camps, Stories Come Alive!)
*   FTGP Lessons &amp; Assembly Talks for the explicit teaching of PSR and CW

&nbsp; &nbsp; **2.&nbsp;Level 2 PSR and CW (Peer Support Leaders &amp; ICT Champions)**<br>**_DZPS 3E&nbsp; - Engage_&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;_Empower_**

*   Training of Peer Support Leaders (PSL) and ICT Champions
*   Platforms for PSLs and ICT Champion to be Serving Leaders:

	*   Provide peer support and help to their peers in their own class / level
	*   Serve as Cyber Wellness ambassadors during NE events to drive CW messages
	*   Promote a Culture of Care in school by welcoming their peers at the start of each term, and doing a proper farewell to their peers at the end of each term.
	*   Promote Inclusivity in our school by peer supporting selected ISPR Students (Building Bridges Programme)
