<h3>Student Well-Being<br>Peer Support &amp; Relationships (PSR) + Cyber Wellness (CW)</h3>
<h4>Vision:</h4>
<p>Every Dazhong student is a Peer Supporter and advocate for Cyber Wellness.</p>
<h4>Mission:</h4>
<p>To create a&nbsp;<strong>Caring</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Enabling</strong>&nbsp;School
environment by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Empowering students to be&nbsp;<strong>positive influencers and leaders</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bridging&nbsp;<strong>the adult and student divide</strong>&nbsp;to strengthen
our student’ safety nets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating a&nbsp;<strong>protective factor</strong>&nbsp;for students at
risk through the building of positive relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contributing to a positive school&nbsp;<strong>Culture of Care</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Key Approaches for Student Well-Being @ DZPS:</h4>
<p>In order to create a&nbsp;<strong>Caring and Enabling</strong>&nbsp;School
environment and strengthen our school’s&nbsp;<strong>Culture of Care</strong>,
the school looks into the various aspects of&nbsp;<strong>Student Well-Being</strong>&nbsp;through
these areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Positive Teacher-Student Relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Positive Peer Support &amp; Relationships&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mental Health</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cyber Wellness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students with Needs</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>It is a whole-school effort to equip all students with the necessary skills
to support their own well-being as well as strengthen their school support
systems (both offline &amp; online). This is further supported by our teachers.
A two-prong approach is thus adopted by our school to address this:</p>
<p><strong>1. Level 1 PSR and CW (All Students)</strong>
<br><strong><em>DZPS 3E&nbsp; - Excite &amp; Engage</em></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Cyber Wellness Weeks (as part of NE events - Total Defence Day, IFD, Racial
Harmony, National Day)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PSR infused as part of School Programmes (e.g. School Camps, Stories Come
Alive!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTGP Lessons &amp; Assembly Talks for the explicit teaching of PSR and
CW</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>2.&nbsp;Level 2 PSR and CW (Peer Support Leaders &amp; ICT Champions)</strong>
<br><strong><em>DZPS 3E&nbsp; - Engage</em>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<em>Empower</em></strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Training of Peer Support Leaders (PSL) and ICT Champions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Platforms for PSLs and ICT Champion to be Serving Leaders:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Provide peer support and help to their peers in their own class / level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serve as Cyber Wellness ambassadors during NE events to drive CW messages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote a Culture of Care in school by welcoming their peers at the start
of each term, and doing a proper farewell to their peers at the end of
each term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote Inclusivity in our school by peer supporting selected ISPR Students
(Building Bridges Programme)</p>
