### Choir

**CCA Overview**

Choir is an engaging, exciting and fun CCA for music lovers! With Choir, the members have the opportunity to highlight their talents in choral singing and develop their passion for music.  As members, they will hone their talents in the field of singing and build discipline and good character during training sessions and performances.

As choral singers, they have a responsibility to focus and memorise the lyrics and master the choral singing techniques taught. It requires hard work and perseverance as each member needs to develop excellence, self-discipline and teamwork to ensure that they sing with pride together harmoniously.  All these are in line with our school vision, mission and motto.  

Opportunities are created for students to showcase their talents through internal and external performances, such as Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF), DZ 85th Anniversary, Hong Kah North National Day Celebration and School Prize Giving Day. Through performances, the students will learn to appreciate music and build their confidence when performing in front of an audience and sing proudly. Our Choir has also collaborated with other schools for exchange programmes and joint concert performances. 

Since 2020, five of our Choir members were given a chance to join as members of Voices of Singapore Childrenâ€™s Choir (VOSCC). The VOSCC seeks to musically develop children as singers, individuals and performers, with great importance placed on character building and inculcating the Singaporean Identity. 

We believe that all these opportunities will excite and engage students and help to develop their stage confidence while having fun and making friends with choristers from different experiences. These will also empower them to be self-directed leaders and serve in our community. Our Choir alumni will also be formed this year 2023. We do welcome all our Choir alumni to come back to serve
