<h3><strong>Direct School Admission for Secondary Schools (DSA-Sec)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What is DSA-Sec?</strong>
</p>
<p>DSA-Sec allows P6 students to apply to some secondary schools before taking
the PSLE. They can apply based on their talent in sports, arts, academic
areas and etc. If your child is admitted to a secondary school through
DSA-Sec, they are not allowed to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>submit school choices during the Secondary 1 (S1) posting process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>transfer to another school. They must commit to their chosen school for
the duration of the programme.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to apply</strong>
</p>
<p>Students and parents can apply through the DSA-Sec Portal. Only one parent
is required to log in using Singpass to apply. There are no application
fees. If you are unable to apply online, please approach the form teacher
for assistance.</p>
