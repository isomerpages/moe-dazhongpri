#### DZPS Guests
To prepare our students to be Citizens of the future, Dazhong Primary School focuses on harnessing international partnerships. Our students are given opportunities to travel on twinning and cultural immersion programmes and as much as we send students out into the world, we also bring the world to our doorstep.&nbsp;  
  
We have hosted many guests from different countries who are interested in finding out more about our school&nbsp; and our curriculum. Hosting guests and visitors with different cultures have definitely benefited our students and enriched them with learning that is beyond their classrooms.
