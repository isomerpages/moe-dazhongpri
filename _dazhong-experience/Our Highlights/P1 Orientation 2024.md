#### P1 Orientation 2024

Time flies and here we go again, welcoming our excited yet anxious Primary 1 students and parents to our school on P1 Orientation Day! It is an important part of the P1 START RIGHT! Transition Programme that provides an opportunity for incoming P1 students to be familiarized with their teachers and learning environment. Such a big milestone for the students!

This time, we also have the Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) who serve beyond self in guiding and providing peer support to the P1 students. Just like any other brothers and sisters would do for their little siblings! They even assisted the teachers with the classroom activities and school tour. What a bunch of caring and helpful serving leaders!

We hope the P1 students and parents had a memorable P1 Orientation Day and we look forward to having them again on the first day of the new school year!

Dazhong, Dare to Shine! =)
